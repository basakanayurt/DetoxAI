"im 48yo . guy . worth about $ 1million . job most people would kill for . talented musician and pretty good at the things i have had control over in life and other than that ? a complete and total fucking loser with relationships . 2 decades of horribly low self esteem has left me totally alone in life . no one gives a fuck about me . i have barely seen a person since covid started in march and i live alone . in march i decided i had to try to get mental health help again or i knew i would fall into a horrible pit . spent $ 100 per hour 2 times a week for the last 6 months via zoom out of my own pocket ( no mental health insurance ) . i knew the woman was not awesome but she was helpful for awhile because she was literally anyone until it all fell apart 2 weeks ago forcing me to end it . i realized the woman while saying she cared did not give a fuck in reality . up until then i actually started to improve things but the way it ended made me worse than when i began . so being completely lonely and literally not talking to anyone or seeing anyone i stumbled onto a camgirl website about 10 days ago . well of course i fall for a girl on there and waste probably $ 1000 in a week . i actually paid her to put her clothes on and just talk . obviously i am a fucking idiot for thinking it was anything but what it was but i was just hoping for just a little compassion and somebody being sweet / nice to me . well of course that just fell apart and i am sure the camgirl does not even realize i am gone and i am crushed . jesus christ my life has gone completely down the tubes . i started investing my money a few years ago in hopes that i might make myself more attractive to woman or at least give me confidence to feel i might be worthy . i cannot even keep the interest of a camgirl i toss $ 1000 at . i do not feel like typing all the real horrible things over the last 20 years of drug abuse , losing friends , etc that i just felt it was appropriate to tell the camgirl story to show how fucking pathetic i am . i honestly need to end myself but i am scared . i pray to myself every night that i die in my sleep . i need to figure out how to kill myself in a way that will actually succeed . i have guns but i am afraid of bleeding out alive for hours . i do not know if i could get the courage to jump off a bridge . i just need help to end myself . i cannot keep going like this . i thought i had things to offer to people and at my age absolutely no one gives a shit about me . please help me end this . any advice is appreciated .

"the soft - toned clock upon the stair chimed three — too sweet for sleep , too early yet to rise . in restful peace i lay with half - closed eyes , watching the tender hours go dreamily ; the tide was flowing in ; i heard the sea shivering along the sands ; while yet the skies were dim , uncertain , as the light that lies beneath the fretwork of some wild - rose tree within the thicket gray . the chanticleer sent drowsy calls across the slumbrous air ; in solemn silence sweet it was to hear my own heart beat . . . then broad and deep and fair — trembling in its new birth from heaven’s womb — one crimson shaft of dawn sank thro’ my room .

"" is , then , the old faith dead , "" they say , "" and in its stead is some new faith proclaimed , that we are forced to remain naked to sun and rain , unsheltered and ashamed ?

"" the saints ! ah , have they grown forgetful of their own ? are they asleep , or dead , that open to the sky their ruined missions lie , no longer tenanted ? "" oh , bring us back once more the vanished days of yore , when the world with faith was filled ; bring back the fervid zeal , the hearts of fire and steel , the hands that believe and build . "" then from our tower again we will send over land and main our voices of command , like exiled kings who return to their thrones , and the people learn that the priest is lord of the land !

and pancho , with his noose ? do you remember full and half and empty ? do you remember sorrow standing in the entry ? do you remember thought , and talking plainly ? michel and i went walking after chartres cathedral had engaged our spirits mainly by giving us an insight into barthes . michel said he was capable of feigning renewed intentions of the soul's deep part , like this cathedral's artificial forces that press a kind of artless thought into our faces . and yet — the moor is dark beneath the moon . the porcupine turns over on its belly and new conceptions rap at the cocoon . civilization , dealing with us fairly , for once , releases its erectheion of understanding , which consoles us , nearly . later we study certain characteristics that may give us a better chance with the statistics . how much i would like to live the whole thing over , but making some corrections as i go ! to be a better husband and a father , be with my babies on a sled in snow . by twenty i would have understood my mother and by compassion found a way to know what separates the what - i - started - out - as from what - i - sometimes - wished - i - was - when - in - the - mountains . to be once more the one who what was worthy of courtship courted — it was quite as stressful as trying to , er , as they say , give birth to a poem and as often unsuccessful , but it was nice to be sublime and flirty with radiant girls , and , in some strange way , restful . i could be everything i was not usually — and then to get somebody else to feel it mutually ! in poems the same problem or a similar . desire of course not only to do old things but things unheard of yet by nuns or visitors and of the melancholy finch be co - finch in singing songs with such a broad parameter that seamstresses would stare , forget to sew things , astronauts quit the sky , athletes the stadium to hear them , and the rest of what they hear be tedium . such wild desires , i think it is recognizable are part and parcel of the human image and in a way , i would say , no less predictable than popeye's feelings for a can of spinach . yet if we are set on course by the invisible , all pre - determined , what about the language that teases me each morning with its leanings toward the unprogrammed altitudes beyond its meanings ? are you , o particles , o atoms , nominatives like percevals and stendhals , set in motion by some ordaining will that is definitive ? is this invading chill and high emotion , this tendency to know one is regenerative , is this , all , tidal take - home like the ocean ? be what you may , my thanks for your society through the long life i have had , your jokes and your variety , the warmth you have shown in giving me a temperature that i can live with , and the strength you have shared with me in arms and legs — and for your part in literature , what can i say ?

"in a morning coat , hands locked behind your back , you walk gravely along the lines in your head . these others stand with you , squinting the city into place , yet cannot see what you see , what you would see — a vision of these paths , laid out like a star , or like a body , the seed vibrating within itself , breaking into the open , dancing up to stop at the end of the universe . i say your vision goes as far as this , the egg of the world , where everything remains , and moves , holding what is most against it against itself , moving , as though it knew its end , against death . in that order , the smallest life , the small event take shape . yes , even here at this point , amma's plan consumes you , the prefigured man , nommo , the son of god . i call you into this time , back to that spot and read these prefigurations into your mind , and know it could not be strange to you to stand in the dark and emptiness of a city not your vision alone . now , i have searched the texts and forms of cities that burned , that decayed , or gave their children away , have been picking at my skin , watching my hand move , feeling the weight and shuttle of my body , listening with an ear as large as god's to catch some familiar tone in my voice . now , i am here in your city , trying to find that spot where the vibration starts . there must be some mistake . over the earth , in an open space , you and i step to the time of another ceremony . these people , changed , but still ours , shake another myth from that egg . some will tell you that beginnings are only possible here , that only the clamor of these drums could bring our god to earth . a city , like a life , must be made in purity . so they call you , knowing you are intimate with stars , to create this city , this body . so they call you , knowing you must purge the ground . “ sir , suffer me to recall to your mind that time , in which the arms and tyranny of the british crown were exerted , with every powerful effort in order to reduce you to a state of servitude : look back , i entreat you , on the variety of dangers to which you were exposed ; reflect on that time , in which every human aid appeared unavailable , and in which even hope and fortitude wore the aspect of inability to the conflict , and you cannot but be led to a serious and grateful sense of your miraculous and providential preservation ; you cannot but acknowledge , that the present freedom and tranquility which you enjoy you have mercifully received , and that it is the peculiar blessing of heaven . ” ",0,,,6236

"i had a boyfriend who told me stories about his family , how an argument once ended when his father seized a lit birthday cake in both hands and hurled it out a second - story window . that , i thought , was what a normal family was like : anger sent out across the sill , landing like a gift to decorate the sidewalk below . in mine it was fists and direct hits to the solar plexus , and nobody ever forgave anyone . but i believed the people in his stories really loved one another , even when they yelled and shoved their feet through cabinet doors , or held a chair like a bottle of cheap champagne , christening the wall , rungs exploding from their holes . i said it sounded harmless , the pomp and fury of the passionate . he said it was a curse being born italian and catholic and when he looked from that window what he saw was the moment rudely crushed . but all i could see was a gorgeous three - layer cake gliding like a battered ship down the sidewalk , the smoking candles broken , sunk deep in the icing , a few still burning .

"please mind any typos , i am sobbing as i type this . i don’t cry easily so i am letting the tears fall as they come . i have so many thoughts and feelings that it would be impossible to condense them all into a readable post . so for a tldr background : i’ve spent the entire summer in my ( second - ) most major depressive episode . i have not left my bed nor talked to any person in the flesh for three months up until three weeks ago . in the past 3 weeks i have attempted to reconnect w my family and get out of bed again . tonight i want to fail . ever since i graduated last year . ( 2019 ) , i’ve become an immense burden on everyone around me . after having no career prospects a month after graduation , i realized that i literally have nothing more to live for . i wasn’t depressed when i thought of it , it was more matter - of - fact since i literally did not have anything going for me . and i wasn’t that depressed abt it bc after getting out of a major depressive episode that had me attempting to kill myself halfway through it ( 2018 ) , everything had still been going emotionally uphill for me despite my loss of purpose . i reached a sort of numbness plateau where i didn’t feel happy nor sad . it was more like , “ nothing could get as worse as it had in 2018 . ” and i was content w that bc i thought i’d be able to get through anything w that mentality . but then 2020 happened . i had just moved to new york trying to get my life together , but after a month of lockdown , i moved back w my mom . i haven’t lived w my parents in 5 years . i felt like a teenager again — trapped in my room bc it was the freest i’d be in the house . my sister was the only person i could really talk to but then i did some regrettable things and now she despises me ( nothing immoral / illegal ) . i ran away to my cousin’s house for a few weeks before coming back to my house . after locking myself in for a while i went out on the streets and tried to get run over . it failed . i tried to go to a different cousin’s house but right when i was on my way there they said i couldn’t come anymore . so i went to the cousins that i stayed w before but they brought me home the next night bc they didn’t want me to stay . they did it in the kindest way possible , but i could still feel myself being an immense burden , i wanted to die . and that’s when i locked myself in my room for 3 months . these past few months i have been able to rehabilitate into a healthier mindset when i had many realizations including the fact that i need to stop thinking that the ppl in my life are responsible for me bc it’s unfair to them . i’ve realized that i can’t take anyone for granted bc of how fragile life is and how we can lose anyone at any time . i’ve thought abt everyone that i loved and who i ( thought ) loved me . i realized that i had to give myself purpose and i couldn’t expect it to automatically come to me without putting in any work . i realized every thought of worthlessness i had came from my own mind bc everyone has their own shit that they deal with . i was so ready to make peace w everyone and be part of the human world again . today i had lunch w my family . the first time we were all together at the table w both me and my sister . it was going well . . . until it didn’t . at one point in the lunch my sister looked at me w disgust in her eyes and brought up the regrettable things i’ve done . i told her that all of her feelings were valid , but she was just so cold . and the way she looked at me was so disheartening . i had apologized for all of the things i’ve done , but i realized that she would never forgive me ( again , nothing immoral / illegal ) . and she’s the only person who understands me . so if i don’t have her i don’t have anyone . and w the sound of her voice and the look she had on her face , i could tell that all she wanted me to do was die . and i realized that no one in my family actually needs me . in the 3 weeks i’ve come back to earth , not one of them has shown relief that i’m finally out of bed . as if there was no difference in their lives between when i was there and when i locked myself in my room . and the only times the ppl i love actually checked up on me was when they needed something from me . and then i realized that it actually isn’t in my head , i actually / am / worthless . on top of that , i still have no job , i haven’t started on giving myself any purpose , and i live in california aka a wildfire state that is due to eventually burn to the ground soon so this week has pretty much confirmed that there’s no future for me anyway . i wanted to post an abridged version of this in bojack sadposting but i deleted facebook for mind - numbing reasons . i’ve been thinking about bojack a lot tonight bc of the widely known debate that “ a view from halway down ” should’ve been the last episode . i hate this debate bc it shouldn’t have been . it ended perfectly . “ a view from halfway down ” suggests that bojack should’ve died and succeeded in killing himself . but that nullifies the entire point of the show . the last episode showed him living through it , as he should . bc the point is that no matter how much bad shit you’ve done and how much you might be hated , no one deserves to die . the point of the entire show is how no matter how shitty you may be , or how shitty your life might be , you gotta live through it . but now , i’m thinking that the ppl who wanted the view from halfway down to be the last episode are trying to make a point . that sometimes you shouldn’t live through it and that it’s better if you die . that some things aren’t forgivable and that the only option is death . and i feel like that might be my sister towards me now . bc she can never forgive me for what i did ( again , nothing immoral / illegal i promise ) and there is absolutely nothing i can do about it . i’ve lost my relationship w her forever and the only thing i can do to somewhat amend it is die . if i died then she’d be happy . my family would be full of grief but in the end they’d realize they’re better off . in a way i want them all to realize how much they actually need me and how they should’ve treated me better and appreciated me more while i was here , but the more that i think about it , the more that i realize that even if they did have any of those thoughts , it would all fade away bc they’d realize how much happier they are without me . i have a few things to live for . i have a kickass halloween costume i just bought yesterday that i really want to get to wear . i have a grad school application that i really want to finish and wait for to see if i get in . but both seem frivolous in comparison to the bigger picture . if i don’t do it tonight i might fuck around and wait til december 31 . if things don’t get better then , then i’ll end it . idk yet . who does . i have so many philosophical thoughts that all play into this but this is the general external gist . it is so hard to be selfless and forgiving in a world that’s so cruel where no one you love actually loves you back . sometimes i wish i had succeeded in killing myself in 2018 . i was in paris standing on the ledge of the pont neuf at 6am on a cold november morning , ready to jump into the seine . i had the note together and everything . i had just finished watching my favorite movie the night before , i was at the prettiest i had been in my life , and i was wearing a killer outfit . it would’ve been beautiful and perfect . but i didn’t . and for what ? to have to live through 2020 and kill myself in my mom’s house 40 pounds heavier in my underwear overdosing on diet pills ? pathetic .

"hi everyone , i do not know if i should be posting this somewhere else or not but i am really tired of keeping things to myself and just to my friends . no , i have not told my family a single god damn thing about anything and i intend to keep it that way because of the serious embarrassment . im going through a really hard breakup as the title says so . i loved someone , and i fell for her hard . before i met her , it was 8 months before i was involved with someone romantically and i locked my heart away from people until i met her . everything was so natural with her that i always had the confidence to ask her to do things with me . when i first met her , i would message her to play video games with me because she was a gamer like i am too . i had a messed up sleeping schedule so every time i logged on to play , she would be there and the previous times i have played with her , it was always really enjoyable and fun . eventually we started playing games together for so long that i thought i met , "" the one . "" the vibes with her were really strong , her presence was always amazing to be around with , we eventually started flirting with each other , but there was just one concern - our age gaps . she is 16 years old , turning 17 in december , whereas i was 19 who just turned 20 last month . we got together right after my birthday . i myself contemplated with the age gap , but i did not think it was bad as it was within a 3 year age gap because she would turn 17 this year as i have already turned 20 . i live in new york city and most states the age of consent is 17 . when we started dating , we expressed how we were handling this and we decided that the age gap would not be an obstacle our first month , it was amazing . it was the standard honeymoon phase . we hung out every day , we would play games every single day , we would sleep on calls together , etc . everything was just fine until a month later , she started being distant towards me . she would spend more time with her friends and would be playing league all day . i never contested this so instead , i would ask her to game with me whenever she would be free , except she would spend whole days and in the times that she would reply to me , she would already be tired . i was disappointed and i felt isolated . when this first started happening , in an afternoon we made plans to play a game . instead , she was taking a really long time so out of frustration , i told her that i was not going to wait anymore and to just have a goodnight . i went to sleep and woke up afterwards and still there was no reply . shortly after , she supposedly woke up and told me to sleep well . i was really angry because instead of explaining to me what was going on , she chose to leave me with a dry response . i told her not to talk to me for a while . 3 days pass by trying to cool my frustration and anger , i finally decided i would talk to her . instead she was gaming with her friend and would not reply until hours later . we finally talked and decided to resolve this through as i told her that i really wanted our relationship to work and i was not looking to start arguments . we were okay until then . awhile after this , she was in the middle of class and her friends started ganging up on me in a group chat , calling me a pedophile and a predator and for preying on children expressing their concerns about the age gap . i was ganged up essentially and not one person in the group chat defended me when i knew two of her best friends , one who helped me out for the 3 days that i was not talking to her , and the other - i told him my entire history on how my relationships went and we got to know each other better . there was another group of friends who knew me as well , but still - no one bothered to defend me . i told them all that if they really had concerns , then they could just talk to me privately about it instead of publicizing everything like that , or they could try to get to know me . awhile after , i messaged her about the whole situation explaining to her about my feelings on how her friends ganged up on me like that in total disregard of my feelings . the situation with her is that she used to have an abusive ex - boyfriend in which her friend groups got involved to help her through them , so these same people were convinced that i was doing the same ? i do not really know what their motivations were other than to just support her , but anyhow she explained to me how her friends used to tease her a lot about the situation and this kind of ganging up was not going to stop and expressed to me how i am just now surprised about the age gap . then she said the words "" if it really made you uncomfortable then maybe it says a lot about you "" , making me feel like i was the one at fault for anything that happened there . i guess i should have just explained to everyone everything on the get - go even while feeling attacked ? i do not really know . anyhow , the rest of the argument was me explaining to her how frustrating it was for me to keep asking her to spend time with me when almost all her time at this point were to her friends and whenever i would ask to fit into her schedule , she would just get tired . when it was late at night , she later broke up with me explaining to me that she does not think the relationship is for the best anymore . her words were , "" i know myself and how i react and choose to do things and it is some of the things you have a problem with that i do not want to change and i know that i wont for a while . like how i spend time with my friends , or when i say things about what i am doing . "" she then explains that the age gap was a concern and her friends are involved and it has not faded and only made things worse , they shared their opinions and it was really tiring for her to explain her choices and her entire relationship with me and already dealt with a situation like this and does not want to do it again . she ends the message by saying that some of our problems were because of her past relationship and it did not fall on me but she does not have the energy or want to put up with that and that she did not want to end on bad terms . my heart fucking sank , and broke into a million pieces . i frantically told her how that was not fair for her to do any of this and how much of a commitment i made to her . i told her i did the very best i could and if i was not enough then i hope someone else is enough for her and then shortly told her that i could not see her or her friends or any of our mutual friends anymore , i blocked her everywhere . for the whole night , i talked about this to my best friend and i have cried for about 4 hours or longer . normally i do not have suicidal thoughts but considering how all my past relationships have ended badly and the poor childhood i had growing up in schools , i really wanted to my best friend talked me out of it the best way she could and expressed how none of this was my fault and how loving i was to her , and that she made a serious mistake , fully believing that her friends were in full influence of her decision . i really thought about just grabbing a knife and stabbing it in my throat or just hang myself or whatever the fuck , but she talked me out of it and so i decided to continue going through the heartbreak . in the middle of my conversation with her , i was privately messaged by two of her friends calling me a pedophile and a predator and that i was "" grooming "" her with "" pedophile tendancies "" and just garbage like that when i have not been anything but loving to her . i knew some of her friends and we would chill having movie nights , i played video games with some of them too and i did the very best i could being friendly with them when i had no idea who they were . most of my text messages to her are full of things like "" i love you "" , "" have a great day "" several times i have continuously had the thought of just ending my life but i am still trying to battle through it by distracting myself by trying to work out recently ( it's a challenge still as i am skinny and i find it hard to build muscle considering my conditions ) and playing video games , but here i am typing this because i am struggling to sleep and i have physical pain from thinking about not just her , but the many amount of times i have been abandoned by people throughout my whole life and the past breakups . infact , i did not even want to write this shit up on reddit in a thread like this because i have been trying to be stronger but really i just break down each and every time . people keep telling me that it is going to get better and i will overcome this , but i genuinely do not know if i will . i am tired of being in physical pain over the breakup , and i do not know if i can find anyone that is better than her . she plays video games like i do , she is attractive , wealthy , very maternal and her family life is well . she can get any guy she wants when i am just a slightly above average looking guy who is 5'3 , skinny , and i am not wealthy , so to her i am just another fucking name when for me , she was surreal . if anyone's made it this far into reading this , i genuinely thank you for your time . still to this day i am finding a lot of trouble trying to get through the heartbreak and if it were not for my best friend who listened to me for over 4 hours of crying , i most likely would have made my decision and nobody would be seeing this post . i hope the rest of you are okay , alive , and well .

"i've overcome so much in my life . . . i'm not obese anymore , i am not in an abusive relationship anymore . i am not below the poverty line anymore . i am not being bullied and taken advantage of by my "" friends "" anymore . i have a degree and a job i enjoy most days . i have a partner and a best friend and money to buy the food i like and go on modest vacations . so . . . it feels like it could be the peak of my life . my problem is that i am experiencing intense bouts of abject suffering on an near daily basis . here is more about me : i generally have mixed feelings about my job . it feels good enough but i want more at the same time . i work 8 - 9 hour days and earn a lower range salary my company is corrupt and only about half of the work i do aligns with my moral values . yet i enjoy my job and i am very skilled at it . i am one of the most valued and appreciated employees . but of course i am itching to work somewhere i believe in . unfortunately , i have almost eached the top of this career path , so now i am faced with changing careers or potencially never earning more money without going back to school . there is so way i can afford more school , though , i am 5 figures in debt from student loans . i want to have a child one day , that is my lfielong dream . but i have only a few years until that biological window starts closing . i have a partner with a pretty lax personality who is willing to consider kids but it is not a huge life goal . we are on a similar tier financially but they are not in debt . i am pretty sure i will never have the financial means or the mental stability to have a child and whenever i think about that my heart rips open and i sob . my parents are immature narcissists who will not go out of their way for anyone and have no real interest in my well being . when i am really suffering . . . i will feel angry with my mom who refused to abort me even though she knew she was too mentally ill to have a child . my dad encouraged the abortion , he never wanted me and he is always been open about that . this family dynamic have me a core trauma , and thus i tend to feel truly unwanted and alone in this world . that is not fair to my partner i know , but it is my affliction in this life . my partner genuinely cares and is one of the only people there for me but even they are getting burnt out . it feels like most interactions begin kindly , but i feel resistant to first to calming down . it is like i must fight my urge to defend myself against a genuine attempt from them to help me . and then , sensing defensiveness , my partner can turn sour with their own defensiveness and impatience , i will become increasingly upset , and we will argue . other than our tendency to trigger one another in conversation , we have built a deep valuable and healthy life together . we are working on improving communication and have improved a lot so far . i only enjoy the company of children and a few select friends . most adults fill me with hatred and judgement and fear as soon as i see them . i have terrible social anxiety . a good morning is enough to make me cringe . i feel like thaf kid on the playground always getting bullied except . . . no on is bullying me ? i also give away my trust quickly but hold a grudge for life of you break it . i have been taken advantage of bc of that . how i am coping i have been diagnosed with many things but do not want to go back on medication , i tried many types and many doctors and they never did anything but reinforce how broken i felt . that being said im so burnt out from breaking down . i wake up everyday like , omg not again . is there no way out of these waves of misery ? i'm so tired of crying , i cry almost every day . i fade in and out of enjoying my hobbies and passions , as well as art and music . my mind has no peace , my daily life has little joy or fulfillment , and when it comes it is painfully fleeting . i feel low today , today is a low day . i have very little hope for the future and i have no will to try to fix any of it . when i feel low , i believe people are fundamentally flawed and selfish . i am afraid i am becoming misanthropic . i feel we are a disgusting species and i am ashamed to be a part of it . on low days , i wonder if i even have the capacity to feel compassion towards anyone including myself . i wonder if i cannot recognize compassion bring shown to me . maybe i am so misanthropic as a result of my trauma that i hate all humans including myself . maybe i feel unworthy of love bc i do not love the very thing i am a part of . when i feel low , all i care about is the next time i can get fucked up enough to escape these feelings of dispair and apathy . that urge terrifies me , perhaps i will become an addict like my parents were . there are a lot of low days . i am distrubed by their prevalence . i'm like a little bruised child in an emotional flashback most of the time . several times a month i lay in bed and wonder if i might die in my sleep at night . i feel sorry for myself and my broken suffering brain . it can feel like a sick joke to be alive . the more i think about it , the more i think perhaps i should not have a child , which begets a new cycle of grief . but enough about low days : on good days i work on my trauma as much as i can through reading phychology , self help and spirituality books . also by researching , meditating , doing yoga , journaling , etc . on good days , i forget how deep and hopeless this despair feels . that is why therapy has never worked for me . i go in fully identified with my current emotion and think of the lows as some kind of dream , simple to obercome . in reverse , when i am upset , it feels like i will never come out of it . . . it's like i cannot fathom that my emotional state will ever change . on good days , i believe i have cured it ! as you can see , i have crippling trouble validating my reality or trusting myself . i feel like even though my life is objectively much more blessed than so many peoples lives , i have recgnition and gratitude for that . yet , i am still experiencing an undue amount of suffering . . . what seems to be more than other people would in my situation . i want to know why that is . i'm intrigued by many spiritual and philosophical ideas . i hope they will give me the keys to turning down my emotional thermostat . i do struggle with consistancy , as you might guess , because frequent days lost to despair do not really support growing new habits . i want more good days but i do not know how to control this thing . . . thank you with the fullness of my heart for the time devoted reading my story . i consider it an act of love and i will do my best to recieve it as such .

"alexandria , 1954 when my grandfather came back from his swim , battered this time by the treacherous currents , the rocks jutting out of the water like knives , my sister and i sidled into his room thinking the house too quiet and saw him like a hurt beast standing by his bed , naked , wet . my grandmother was kneeling , toweling his calves , my mother was mixing a poultice . “ look at his bruises , ” my sister was whispering , “ and the veins like swollen rivers . ” we kept inching toward him while my grandmother daubed him with cream and wound him in a bedsheet and made him odder than any dream of him . “ children , ” she said turning toward us , “ let him sleep , this is your grandfather . ” we hurried away , having said not a word to him , nor he to us , though our eyes had never left his body and we ached to touch him , brush our fingertips along the webs of cuts and discolorations in his pale skin . all day we wished he would somehow rise like a true ghost , the sheet ruffling in the drafts ; “ grandfather , ” we whispered at his closed door , “ come to us , bring us your stories , ” but when the last lights were put out that night and the dark spread about us like a purple bruise we wished we had never wished what we had , every waft of wind had a rustle to it and the sound of water was deep in our ears and by morning , he had become for us in his shut room the ghostliest of imaginings , and keeping our distance , we waited only for his door to suddenly swing forth and reveal him standing either healed and smiling and unstrange , or what seemed likelier to us now , about to change our lives .

"sonnet 19 ( on his blindness ) by john milton 1 . spent in sonnet 19 , milton makes the seemingly deliberate choice to avoid “ the ” and “ a ” — respectively , the most common and the sixth most common words in english usage . instead of these articles — definite and indefinite — the poem stages a territorial dispute between possessives : the octave is “ my ” land , the sestet is “ his ” land , with the occasional “ this ” or “ that ” flagging no man’s land . we come to understand milton’s mistake — the professed regret of the poem — as this act of claiming . it is only through his taking possession that the universal light is divided up , apportioned into “ my light ” — a finite commodity that by being subjected to ownership becomes capable of being “ spent . ” “ spent ” — a word like a flapping sack . my mistake was similar . i came to consider my body — its tug - of - war of tautnesses and slacknesses — to be entirely my own , an appliance for generating various textures and temperatures of friction . should i have known , then , that by this act of self - claiming , i was cutting myself off from the eternal , the infinite , that i had fashioned myself into a resource that was bounded and , therefore , exhaustible ? 2 . wide the “ wide ” is always haunted by surprise . in a dark world , the “ wide ” is the sudden door that opens on unfurling blackness , the void pooling at the bottom of the unlit stairs . to be bounded is our usual condition ; to be open is anomalous , even excessive . a wide - eyed girl is extreme in her unliddedness , her bare membranes flinching at any contact , vulnerable to motes , to smuts , to dryness . a wide - hipped girl extends the splayed arches of her body to bridge the generational divide . a wide - legged girl unseals a portal between persons ; she is disturbing to the extent that she is open to all comers , a trapdoor that must be shut for safety’s sake . a wide - eyed girl is often thought desirable ; a wide - hipped girl is often thought eligible ; a wide - legged girl is often thought deplorable . a wide - legged girl is rarely wide - eyed , though she may have started out that way . we can understand why milton , in the narrowing orbit of his blindness , would have considered wideness , unboundedness to be threatening . what’s less clear is why the wideness of the wide - legged girl is also considered threatening . does the wideness of the wide - legged girl evoke a kind of blindness , a dark room where one might blunder into strangers , the way two men once met each other in me ? 3 . hide “ but why hide it in a hole ? ” asks the master , returning from his long absence , sparks of bewilderment flaring into rage . an unanswered question worries at the parable of the talents : why is the master so terribly angry ? it is not as if the servant had stolen the money , or spent it — his sin is one of omission , of overly risk - averse investing . a talent was a unit of weight in ancient greece : in monetary terms , it was worth eighty pounds of silver , or 6 , 000 denarii — nearly twenty years’ wages for the average worker . but milton uses the word in its more modern sense , dating from the fifteenth century : a natural ability or skill . how did a word for a deadweight of metal come to mean something inborn , innate ? confusion between the inorganic and the natural trickles into the parable and the poem . the master prides himself on being a man who reaps where he has not sown and gathers where he did not scatter seed . was the servant’s fault to confuse coins for seeds , did he think he was planting when he was merely burying , did he mistake for viable what had no chance of living , what had never been alive ? 4 . bent and what about the hole , which for so long had held treasure ? did it wonder why — despite all the moistness and richness it could muster — those cold , glinting seeds never sprouted ? did it understand that , if released into the wider world , the coins could have quickened , multiplied ? that instead of an incubator , the hole had become an oubliette , a place where otherwise fruitful things were sent to languish , to become lodged , useless ? “ useless ” — a word like a capped lead pipe , like the extra bone in my foot i will never pass down to my daughter . a thing becomes useless if it is bent out of shape . to “ get bent ” is to be put to another kind of use , a use my therapist considered tantamount to rape . to bend is to be bound , to bow down without breaking , with perhaps just the head tilted at an angle so as to peer upward . 5 . present the master has become the maker . the servile body wholly “ his , ” splayed wide in a welcome - home , bound up in a beribboned bow . but the reader will object . this is all wrong . first of all , in the sonnet , “ bent ” doesn’t mean to bow down as if in submission to an outside force , but instead denotes an innate or internalized tendency or inclination . second , a “ present ” is not a gift , but a verb meaning to offer openly , full - faced , the sun beaming down on a clean page . third , the body never comes into it at all . “ therewith ” — a safe word , a strongbox to be buried . 6 . chide is a “ true account ” a story or a sum ? is the maker an audience or an auditor ? the page scoured white by little grains of fear . a story has an ending . a sum has a bottom line . there was no accounting for me because my allotment leaked out of me , month after month , i scrubbed the sheets as if effacing the marks of a crime . then one day the fear reversed itself . like a photo negative but in higher contrast — its whites more glaring and its darks more glossy , as if a whisper - thin suspicion had come unzipped . “ chide ” is an enormous understatement . the servant isn’t merely scolded , he is cast into “ the outer darkness ” where there is “ weeping and gnashing of teeth . ” if the “ outer darkness ” is deemed to be a punishment , then does that lustrous inner darkness count as a reward ? 7 . denied it seems unfair , is milton’s point . to be assigned a task , but not provided sufficient materials to complete it , is to be placed in a situation of contrived scarcity , like a lab rat or like the youngest sister in a fairy tale . the parable of the wise and foolish virgins — which prefaces the parable of the talents — centers on this scarcity . the virgins wait for the bridegroom , to greet him with lamps alight . five virgins have brought extra flasks of oil , but five virgins have let their lamps burn out and must go lampless into the night to look for oil . that much we are told , but questions hover around the shadowed margins of the story . why isn’t the bridegroom with the bride ? why is he so delayed ? why is the bridegroom met in the middle of the night by a phalanx of lamp - bearing virgins , like a troupe of pom - pom girls or like a sacrificial rite ? the virginity of the virgins renders them piquant , memorable . adorning gothic portals , evoking thresholds , entrances , they are a particular feature of french cathedrals — much more so , one suspects , than if the parable had called them “ maidservants ” or even “ bridesmaids . ” the presumed desideratum of the story does not interest us much : the sated bridegroom at the midnight feast , the smug , unctuous faces of the wise virgins . instead , the imagination pursues the foolish virgins rushing into the night , their desperation making them vulnerable , their vulnerability making them erotic , the fill - holes of their useless lamps dark and slick with oil . is this how i was taught to sexualize insufficiency , the lack that set me wandering night after night , my body too early emptied out ? 8 . prevent “ prevent ” — a word like a white sheet folded back to cover the mouth . a white egg bursts from the ovary and falls away , leaving a star - shaped scar . corpus albicans , the whitening body . such starbursts , at first , are scattered constellations , frost embroidering a dark field . but at what point does this white lacework shift over from intricacy to impossibility , opacity , obstacle — the ice disc clogging the round pond , the grid of proteins baffling the eye ? “ prevent ” — a word that slams shut , a portcullis ( latin : cataracta ) . letter to leonard philaras , september 28 , 1654 : “ the dimness which i experience by night and day , seems to incline more to white than to black . ” 9 . need has patience been looming in the background all along , silent , so as not to intrude upon a blind man’s consciousness ? patience , whose garment is “ white and close - fitting so that it is not blown about or disturbed by the wind . ” at the turn of the sonnet , patience pries open its sculpted lips , its stiff tongue like a weaver’s shuttle drawing woolly strands through the warp and weft of milton’s blindness , a white monologue that admits neither interruption nor rejoinder . milton’s little murmur stitched back into his mouth . woven tight enough to repel need — a liquid beading on the surface , the blood the needles drew from me week after week , hundreds of stoppered vials consigned to the biohazard bin , en route to the incinerator . “ need , ” from the high german , for danger . “ murmur , ” from the sanskrit , a crackling fire . 10 . best the best beam in contentment , ranging themselves in rows . erect as test tubes but forswearing undue pride in such uprightness , mustering shoulder - to - shoulder with the fellow - elect . the best arrayed in regimental ranks , in refrigerated racks , white hymn of the unneeded , white hum of the unneeding . “ best , ” originally superlative of bot ( old english : remedy , reparation ) . the best affect a pious pose , mouths held taut in tongueless os . sotto voce chorus of that soft , subjunctive song : if you were complete . . . if you were replete . . . superlative . the most remediated . the most repaired . 11 . state to be scooped out , emptied of need and rinsed clean of its greasy smears , pristine as a petri dish on a stainless lab table . enucleated , the white of the egg awaiting an unknown yolk . “ yolk ” from geolu ( old english : yellow ) . not to be confused with “ yoke ” from geocian ( old english : to be joined together ) . a yoke is an implement , meant to be used , to fill a need . but where there is no field to be plowed , no wagon to be pulled , why demand a yoke that is useless , needless ? one day the romans sent for cincinnatus to lead the republic against the invading aequian army . he laid down his plow in the field and went to war . when the aequians surrendered , cincinnatus spared their lives but decreed that they must “ pass under the yoke . ” the romans fashioned a yoke from three spears , two fixed in the ground , and one tied across the tops of the two verticals . since the horizontal spear was only a few feet off the ground , the aequians were made to crouch down like animals in order to complete the surrender . this is thought to be the origin of the word “ subjugate , ” to be brought under the yoke . to bear a yoke is to be bowed down , oxbowed , cowed . one day they laid me down on a gurney , my feet strapped in stirrups , my legs bent and splayed like the horns of a white bull . 12 . speed but why would milton , of all people , use the word “ kingly ” as a compliment ? roundheaded milton , who wrote tract after tract in defense of regicide , who would later be detained for opposing the restoration ? at this point , our suspicions are confirmed : milton has disappeared entirely from the poem . we haven’t heard from him since the turn of the sonnet . we’ve been lulled by the cadenced voice of patience , its dusty tongue self - lubricating , its pallid breath clouding the room , precipitating frangible chains of hydrocarbons , their branchings barbed like fluffs of eiderdown . through the faint reticulations , we discern no dark stoop - shouldered figure , but only white - robed forms , upright as if hung from hooks , their faces unyielding as lanterns , shuttered as if once aflame . 13 . rest rest — a word like a gauze bandage , a ropy weave of collagen knitting its way across a wound . outspread as if fingered , gelid gestures suggesting solace : to stanch , to shield , to seal , to shut off . rest — the rind of the best , a contoured pod that cradles the shape of what it doesn’t hold . rest — those who are left when thousands have sped away , the bereft , who litter the land , with husks for hands , vacant - eyed , vacant faces raised like basins under a contrail - scarred sky . 14 . wait to stand and wait is a task far weightier than simply to wait . it is to permit the distractible body neither ease nor action , nor food nor drink nor any such reprieve ; it is to pit the body in enmity against its own heaviness . to abide in readiness as in a winter orchard , the lacerated land bandaged in snow . to exist inert as if limbless , skin seamless as if reknit over what had been pruned away , knotted rootstock fit for no other service : no branch , no leaf , no fruit . to persist as a stripped stick persists in a white field , bark peeled back from one exposed split , uptilted as if eager for the grafted slip . to stand and wait for the one who reaps where he has not sown . mercy sugars the starving soil with nitrogen , potassium , phosphate . mercy captures rain in silver beads and stitches them through the threadbare weave of cloud . mercy wields a scalpel cutting a cleft in the lopped - off stump , mercy forces home the rootless wand , mercy seals the join with tar and tape . to foster the raw scion as if it were a son , to siphon light down through its body as if it were your own .

"my mother was not impressed with her beauty ; once a year she put it on like a costume , plaited her black hair , slick as cornsilk , down past her hips , in one rope - thick braid , turned it , carefully , hand over hand , and fixed it at the nape of her neck , stiff and elegant as a crown , with tortoise pins , like huge insects , some belonging to her dead mother , some to my living grandmother . sitting on the stool at the mirror , she applied a peachy foundation that seemed to hold her down , to trap her , as if we never would have noticed what flew among us unless it was weighted and bound in its mask . vaseline shined her eyebrows , mascara blackened her lashes until they swept down like feathers ; her eyes deepened until they shone from far away . now i remember her hands , her poor hands , which , even then were old from scrubbing , whiter on the inside than they should have been , and hard , the first joints of her fingers , little fattened pads , the nails filed to sharp points like old - fashioned ink pens , painted a jolly color . her hands stood next to her face and wanted to be put away , prayed for the scrub bucket and brush to make them useful . and , as i write , i forget the years i watched her pull hairs like a witch from her chin , magnify every blotch — as if acid were thrown from the inside . but once a year my mother rose in her white silk slip , not the slave of the house , the woman , took the ironed dress from the hanger — allowing me to stand on the bed , so that my face looked directly into her face , and hold the garment away from her as she pulled it down .

hi all i am new to this sub reddit . i will just get straight to the point . since i was around 14 ( 21 now ) i have had thoughts of all killing myself . i always feel that i am a burden on other people . i always just feel like an outsider that can never be normal . school and my social anxiety have been really weighing me down a lot lately and i feel theres no point to go on anymore . i just always feel like shit and whenever i try to fix myself it always ends up failing . i feel kind of privileged in saying that i do have a caring family and great friends but i just feel that not even any words they say to me can help me . maybe i am insane or something but i feel that hiding my identity and joining this sub reddit can somehow help get through it . if you are reading this i just wanna say thank you . ,1,,,419
"boston common , december 6 , 1882 during the transit of venus i love all sights of earth and skies , from flowers that glow to stars that shine ; the comet and the penny show , all curious things , above , below , hold each in turn my wandering eyes : i claim the christian pagan’s line , humani nihil , — even so , — and is not human life divine ? when soft the western breezes blow , and strolling youths meet sauntering maids , i love to watch the stirring trades beneath the vallombrosa shades our much - enduring elms bestow ; the vender and his rhetoric’s flow , that lambent stream of liquid lies ; the bait he dangles from his line , the gudgeon and his gold - washed prize . i halt before the blazoned sign that bids me linger to admire the drama time can never tire , the little hero of the hunch , with iron arm and soul of fire , and will that works his fierce desire , — untamed , unscared , unconquered punch ! my ear a pleasing torture finds in tones the withered sibyl grinds , — the dame sans merci’s broken strain , whom i erewhile , perchance , have known , when orleans filled the bourbon throne , a siren singing by the seine . but most i love the tube that spies the orbs celestial in their march ; that shows the comet as it whisks its tail across the planets’ disks , as if to blind their blood - shot eyes ; or wheels so close against the sun we tremble at the thought of risks our little spinning ball may run , to pop like corn that children parch , from summer something overdone , and roll , a cinder , through the skies . grudge not to - day the scanty fee to him who farms the firmament , to whom the milky way is free ; who holds the wondrous crystal key , the silent open sesame that science to her sons has lent ; who takes his toll , and lifts the bar that shuts the road to sun and star . if venus only comes to time , ( and prophets say she must and shall , ) to - day will hear the tinkling chime of many a ringing silver dime , for him whose optic glass supplies the crowd with astronomic eyes , — the galileo of the mall . dimly the transit morning broke ; the sun seemed doubting what to do , as one who questions how to dress , and takes his doublets from the press , and halts between the old and new . please heaven he wear his suit of blue , or don , at least , his ragged cloak , with rents that show the azure through ! i go the patient crowd to join that round the tube my eyes discern , the last new - comer of the file , and wait , and wait , a weary while , and gape , and stretch , and shrug , and smile , ( for each his place must fairly earn , hindmost and foremost , in his turn , ) till hitching onward , pace by pace , i gain at last the envied place , and pay the white exiguous coin : the sun and i are face to face ; he glares at me , i stare at him ; and lo ! my straining eye has found a little spot that , black and round , lies near the crimsoned fire - orb’s rim . o blessed , beauteous evening star , well named for her whom earth adores , — the lady of the dove - drawn car , — i know thee in thy white simar ; but veiled in black , a rayless spot , blank as a careless scribbler’s blot , stripped of thy robe of silvery flame , — the stolen robe that night restores when day has shut his golden doors , — i see thee , yet i know thee not ; and canst thou call thyself the same ? a black , round spot , — and that is all ; and such a speck our earth would be if he who looks upon the stars through the red atmosphere of mars could see our little creeping ball across the disk of crimson crawl as i our sister planet see . and art thou , then , a world like ours , flung from the orb that whirled our own a molten pebble from its zone ? how must thy burning sands absorb the fire - waves of the blazing orb , thy chain so short , thy path so near , thy flame - defying creatures hear the maelstroms of the photosphere ! and is thy bosom decked with flowers that steal their bloom from scalding showers ? and hast thou cities , domes , and towers , and life , and love that makes it dear , and death that fills thy tribes with fear ? lost in my dream , my spirit soars through paths the wandering angels know ; my all - pervading thought explores the azure ocean’s lucent shores ; i leave my mortal self below , as up the star - lit stairs i climb , and still the widening view reveals in endless rounds the circling wheels that build the horologe of time . new spheres , new suns , new systems gleam ; the voice no earth - born echo hears steals softly on my ravished ears : i hear them “ singing as they shine ” — a mortal’s voice dissolves my dream : my patient neighbor , next in line , hints gently there are those who wait . o guardian of the starry gate , what coin shall pay this debt of mine ? too slight thy claim , too small the fee that bids thee turn the potent key the tuscan’s hand has placed in thine . forgive my own the small affront , the insult of the proffered dime ; take it , o friend , since this thy wont , but still shall faithful memory be a bankrupt debtor unto thee , and pay thee with a grateful rhyme .

"i'm in canada btw , if that makes any difference . so basically , last thursday i called a suicide hotline . it did make me feel better to talk someone . the lady on the other end was calm , patient and kind . i am actively suicidal right now and i was actively suicidal then too . i have already cut off my best friend , changed my # so that she cannot reach me & i e - transfered her all my money . i have written my note too . i also had a plan ( subway ) . i started the phone call by asking her if she could see my number . she told me that she couldn't , which i now know is untrue . she was so nice but by the end she said that she had "" serious concerns for my safety . "" she ended up pulling up my number and gave me an ultimatum - the suicide hotline ( a different responder ) would call back at an agreed upon time to check in with me and make sure i was safe or she would have to call the police to locate me . of course , i chose the first option . she was a really nice person and i know that she was just doing what she had to do ( and i understand why she did it ) . anyway , the second person i talked to the next day ( because that was what we had agreed upon ) was also so sweet . i started the conversation by saying that i wished that the first girl had been honest with me about being able to see my number . we talked for about 1 . 5 hours . i genuinely felt better afterward . i asked her if she was going to call the police . she told me that she wasn't . i asked her to promise . she promised . ( again , i totally understand why she broke that promise but i still wish that she hadn't . apart from that , she was so so sweet and helpful ) . i was actually very surprised to see the police though , because i had told her that i was safe and had no immediate plans , and i did not think i was going to kill myself anytime soon . all of that to say . . . . i am fixated on killing myself . it is almost the only thing i think about . i do not get a break from my mind and from my memories . i need to punish myself for being a bad person . i am at 98 % . . . i am so , so close . i am in so much pain . talking to them was genuinely helpful . but i do not want to get the police called on me again ( i had to go to the hospital and deal with all that too - i am in canada though so at least it is free ) . sooo . . . if i were to hide my phone number and put it on "" hide caller id "" would they still be able to somehow see it or call the police on me or locate me in some way ? ? thanks for taking the time to read this xx",1,,,577
"so i have an unfortunate long history of failed suicide attempts . some closer than others and plenty of ambulance related hospital visits , but this time was the closest i have ever came to death and all i can say is i am scared of dying . not in the sense of the unknown , but just the experience i had last week really put me in my place . so a little back story . i have been away from my home for a good 5 months due to lock down . i have been staying with my lovely girlfriend . i finally came back home after that time and as soon as i came home i had problems with my breathing . coughing constantly ( will add i had a covid test before coming home and was negative ) but i just could not get over this cough fest . i had previously been diagnosed years ago with mild asthma . so i just thought it was my allergies since i live next to a farm field . that ended up not being the case . i had black mold in my room that developed when i was away and it took its toll on me . after taking antihistamines it seemed to help a little . unfortunately on the sunday that day i had an episode where i was tight chested and my blue inhaler was needed , but only helped a little that day . coming into the night i was trying to sleep and just could not get a breath . i knocked on my parents door at around 2ish am and spoke to nhs 24 where they sent paramedics to my house two units pulled up about 15 minutes after the call and i was given a nebuliser wirh a couple different drugs and nothing was working and i was getting worse . so they decided to put me in the ambulance which i started panicking because my breathing was becoming harder . as i was being put in the ambulance all i can remember was screaming for help and after that my mind went blank . i remember hallucinating about my life and that i was in pain . it was a terrifying experience . i was pumped with adrenaline twice whilst in transit and they thought they would have to put a tube down my throat because i could not breathe myself . luckily i came to and remember asking if i died which they replied i hadn't . i arrived at ninewells hospital in dundee , scotland and was hooked up and loaded with needles and pumped with drugs i cannot name . was told i might have to be put to sleep because my body was working to hard and was not getting enough oxygen ( my lips were blue ) and could not breathe properly on my own . luckily that was not the case . i still was not out of the woods . they put me in the icu and i was doing okay then was moved up the the respiratory ward where i spent the rest of the week . i am home now and after that close encounter i am scared of dying . weird way to cure your feelings of death huh ? i almost died that night . even the doctors thought i was not gonna make it , but here i am . i am thankful for the nhs and what they have done . life is worth living and i did not understand that until i almost lost my life .

"under the fire escape , crouched , one knee in cinders , i pulled the ball - peen hammer from my belt , cracked a square of window pane , the gummed latch , and swung the window , crawled through that stone hole into the boiler room of canton elementary school , once canton high , where my father served three extra years as star halfback and sprinter . behind a flashlight’s cane of light , i climbed a staircase almost a ladder and found a door . on the second nudge of my shoulder , it broke into a hallway dark as history , at whose end lay the classroom i had studied over and over in the deep obsession of memory . i swept that room with my light — an empty blackboard , a metal table , a half - globe lying on the floor like a punctured basketball — then followed that beam across the rows of desks , the various catalogs of lovers , the lists of all those who would and would not do what , until it stopped on the corner desk of the back row , and i saw again , after many years the name of my father , my name , carved deep into the oak top . to gauge the depth i ran my finger across that scar , and wondered at the dreams he must have lived as his eyes ran back and forth from the cinder yard below the window to the empty practice field to the blade of his pocket knife etching carefully the long , angular lines of his name , the dreams he must have laid out one behind another like yard lines , in the dull , pre - practice afternoons of geography and civics , before he ever dreamed of savo sound or guadalcanal . in honor of dreams i sank to my knees on the smooth , oiled floor , and stood my flashlight on its end . half the yellow circle lit the underedge of the desk , the other threw a half - moon on the ceiling , and in that split light i tapped the hammer easy up the overhang of the desk top . nothing gave but the walls’ sharp echo , so i swung again , and again harder , and harder still in half anger rising to anger at the stubborn joint , losing all fear of my first crime against the city , the county , the state , whatever government claimed dominion , until i had hammered up in the ringing dark a salvo of crossfire , and on a frantic recoil glanced the flashlight , the classroom spinning black as a coma . i’ve often pictured the face of the teacher whose student first pointed to that topless desk , the shock of a slow hand rising from the back row , their eyes meeting over the question of absence . i’ve wondered too if some low authority of the system discovered that shattered window , and finding no typewriters , no business machines , no audiovisual gear missing , failed to account for it , so let it pass as minor vandalism . i’ve heard nothing . and rarely do i fret when i see that oak scar leaning against my basement wall , though i wonder what it means to own my father’s name .

"i'm 25f . employed with a decent job , a beautiful home , parents who have given me every opportunity life has , a sister who has been more understanding than i deserve , friends , a car , you name it . i am privileged and i can acknowledge that . i have no logical reason to feel this way . as far back as i can remember , i somehow have still felt this way . i first started therapy when i was 14 . shortly after i was diagnosed depressed among other mental disorders ( ednos , bpd , generalized anxiety , ptsd ) . in high school i attempted three times before the age of 17 , at which point they shipped me to another state to treat my eating disorder thinking it would solve the issue . i was badly bullied in high school and leaving for half of junior year only made that worse . nonetheless , upon graduating i had my last attempt , in 2014 / 15 ( can't remember ) where i took a whole bottle of xanax . i do not remember a lot of my hospital stay other than them forcing me to sign a paper to commit myself after i had been stabilized , threatening to keep me longer if i wouldn't . upon release and after numerous attempts at outpatient therapy i attended a generalized rehab , that had both inpatient and outpatient and encouraged everyone to take control of their lives . i have been going there on and off for about 4 - 5 years now , both in and outpatient , and after the last admission i was doing the best i had been doing in years . i settled much of the ptsd due to sexual assault with emdr , was able to go off all my meds and am only currently taking prn , and have stabilized myself greatly between maintaining a consistent job , saving money , engaging with a healthy group of friends ( one is my long time best friend and her fiancé brought the others in ) , and am finally actively engaging with my family . all this being said , i seem to get hung up on this feeling . it is been there my whole life . to attempt being logical against my emotions is useless . i feel i honestly have no place in this world . that no one understands me . that i am a misfit . i have had many horrible things happen to me throughout my life , like losing many friends to death of all causes though they were young or even the rape , but everyone has horrible things happen to them , and the majority of these people survive and actually thrive after . i know i am still young . i know i should have my whole life ahead of me . something in me recently snapped . i do not know what . i could write a novel about the recent events and then allow you to analyze what is wrong . but the reality is that i do not care anymore . nothing is real in this world . if i died , maybe people would be sad for a while . go through the stages of grief . but the reality is that life goes on . people move on . having lost friends myself i can verify this . the world did not stop spinning just because they died young . i may be changed or have cried for weeks but the world went on . i certainly could ask for help as i am fortunate to have an abundance of it . but the truth is that after 11 years in and out of treatment and with consistently attending therapy , i think if i actually wanted help then i would have made the suggested changes by now . the way i see it , i am a waste of everyone's money and time . i do not care to consistently try . i have never been good at consistency . and i have always been emotionally sensitive to others and their perceptions either of me or my actions . the reality is i care about others when i should care for myself , and i care for myself when i should care for others . i feel i do not know myself and i do all at once . and i feel misunderstood by the ones i want to understand me the most . a year ago i read a post that told me if i want to die , give it a year . see what changes . and for a while that went very , very well . something is telling me i do not have any time left . i have felt like this for weeks . months , maybe . i do not know . i have lost track of time . i do not want to overdose again as i know it will not work . i have tried before . i am getting tired of constantly feeling pain and suffering with only small moments of content or happiness . i think i need to leave this time , for real . for good . i do not know how much more i can take . i plan to write letters to those i care for most as a goodbye , and if i still feel this way i think i might hang myself . i cannot do this anymore . i do not expect responses and i understand my post is long and erratic . there is a lot i have not said even . i just needed to get it out . thank you .

"i i wandered through a house of many rooms . it grew darker and darker , until , at last , i could only find my way by passing my fingers along the wall . suddenly my hand shot through an open window , and the thorn of a rose i could not see pricked it so sharply that i cried aloud . ii i dug a grave under an oak - tree . with infinite care , i stamped my spade into the heavy grass . the sod sucked it , and i drew it out with effort , watching the steel run liquid in the moonlight as it came clear . i stooped , and dug , and never turned , for behind me , on the dried leaves , my own face lay like a white pebble , waiting . iii i gambled with a silver money . the dried seed - vessels of “ honesty ” were stacked in front of me . dry , white years slipping through my fingers one by one . one by one , gathered by the croupier . “ faites vos jeux , messieurs . ” i staked on the red , and the black won . dry years , dead years ; but i had a system , i always staked on the red . iv i painted the leaves of bushes red and shouted : “ fire ! fire ! ” but the neighbors only laughed . “ we cannot warm our hands at them , ” they said . then they cut down my bushes , and made a bonfire , and danced about it . but i covered my face and wept , for ashes are not beautiful even in the dawn . v i followed a procession of singing girls who danced to the glitter of tambourines . where the street turned at a lighted corner , i caught the purple dress of one of the dancers , but , as i grasped it , it tore , and the purple dye ran from it like blood upon the ground . vi i wished to post a letter , but although i paid much , still the letter was overweight . “ what is in this package ? ” said the clerk , “ it is very heavy . ” “ yes , ” i said , “ and yet it is only a dried fruit . ” vii i had made a kite , on it i had pasted golden stars and white torches , and the tail was spotted scarlet like a tiger - lily , and very long . i flew my kite , and my soul was contented watching it flash against the concave of the sky . my friends pointed at the clouds ; they begged me to take in my kite . but i was happy seeing the mirror shock of it against the black clouds . then the lightning came and struck the kite . it puffed — blazed — fell . but still i walked on , in the drowning rain , slowly winding up the string .

"i wonder if anyone ever thought to tell time with them know where their shadow tipped on 3 o'clock which floor which parking spot from a window desk or if they ever stood completely over their own shade's dot that moment they had no metered footprint ; a peek - a - boo we now find ticketed as a before and an after an either side of a space the zero pulls into , its long reserve wheel of nothing there . yet here a gnomon of absence bears its shadow placement on some dial of brevity and cold about life about the footprint we may leave empty of light empty of even point to it . here it is flat and densely packed with people unlike the empty open of the plain ; here our expanse the grown over dumpsite of the meadowlands wetlands or the shore is corps of engineered the bulldozer - beetle's ball of dung shines in it and somewhere the body hidden in our shit to fake us innocent . . . one of our jokes sometimes things rise and float . we in the morning catch , from the train , in the green garbage runoff , sight of white herons and the cormorants . when they’re there in the evening , we safely assume the world hasn’t gone anywhere ; a take of bearings the same the next morning when we’d see the lit towers on the island we were headed for we see now the hour . from the jersey side we take a bearing , as on mountains from the vantage of the plain , on the towers from the vantage of the dirt - stiffened , unyielding , tarmac of marsh grass gray like steel grayed a vegetable steel from blur and the exhausts of the turnpike . position with regard to surrounding objects here is unlike in the mountains which give a bearing even from deep within them , let you see them from inside their formation . climbing to the high plateau of the street from the subway , we check the peaks downtown or midtown skyscrapers for direction . walk a few doors up the block they parallax eclipsed by the postcard we no more see . * there was a deep well lit its entire depth at noon on the solstice light without shadow : so with an in - line position with regard to the sun any cast line of shadow would indicate a curve ; the distance between one and not , an arc of circumference . that phrase of the psalm says death’s shadow is as deep as that valley which is our grave ; its length is the same cast everywhere as deep ; no one’s is further from death than another’s ; death surrounds us is our uncurbed circumference . we map our way with only the bearing of surrounding life itself borderless uncontrolled by the surface of our self . the bridge towers of the verrazano are so far apart they tilt away from each other on the curve of the earth factored in . i wonder if from the distance apart of the the towers you could figure that reach ‘round of the world with this method of shadow ? the shadow of flesh casts how deep and far a landscape of perspective ? how round a circumference enough to fit the living world does a single life turning to its labor spin ? take each story of a building as the radius of expansion we make of the earth , concentric spheres on turtle island , the hundred ten circumferences go nova so high a reach of vision set on so short a perspective the world on the turtle's back : at top , the wake of star formation at base , the animal god . the jealous need , a stomach of feet trying to stand through this . what can we say of our own that stand in newark say so far adrift from a chance to wash that the dirt on her feet cracks into sores the skin of her soles and steps her in one more shit infection she has to kick , one more occupation of her body by her monkey rulers she will have to throw off into space off her back burned out but clear of starring habit . of her destroyed sun say it endows the landfill on which to build a new development “ we are the stuff of stars , ” sagan says .

"i do not know if anyone's gonna read this . but if you do , i am sorry for what you are about to read . this is the only way i can go on , writing and writing until my fingers bleed . i'm from europe , i am 24 and i have been dreaming about my death since i was 8 years old . tonight i just need to write all the shit that is inside my head because i cannot sleep . somebody from my family met a guy over the internet , the time where icq was a thing and other strange video chat shit that i cannot think of and till this day it drives me crazy . he was from italy , at the time he was 42 years old , they used to talk over the internet for a long period of time , especially at night and i was left alone while i needed to clean the house ( where it was full of trash , animal feces , old food , not a single piece of clothes washed it was all on the floor ) and take care of her . i was used to that . . . my brothers went living with my great grandmother , we are brothers from different fathers , their father is white , they are blue eyed blond guys , and my dad was black ( my mom's white ) and the family took a long time to accept it . . . so i was and am an outcast . when i was 2 he used to give me beer and then he abandoned me . moving on . . . she and the italian man had a kinky shit that she was his slave , she called him master , he had a nickname , an animal collar and everything for her . i did not care because i was all alone . one day she called me to get in the room and say hi via webcam . . . little did i know that in that moment i was becoming a sex slave for the next 3 , 5 years . remember . . . i was 8 . lemme take you to the first time we have met him in person . we saw him at the airport , dressed the same , wearing the same type of shoes , he came with his 2 daughters and his wife , he winked at me , and my heart dropped . later that night he decided we should be together , inside the car . with her next to him . he told me to get in the passenger seat in front of him . i still remember his hands on me , the smell , his eyes , his mouth . . . the taste . . . and she got mad because he wanted me . she watched everything . and this kept going and going and going and going and going . . . i experienced every type of fetish you can think about , you name it . every night we had sessions from 10 pm till 3 am , where he told us or her what to do to me . it was so much to handle that i started smoking at 9 years old , i started cutting , stopped eating , my hair was so bad that when i went to the office of my aunt she would take me to the bathroom and used hand cream mixed with water to comb it . i slept with her in an air mattress in front of the computer while it was being recorded , i never had a bed . . . i could only take a bath when he told , i could only eat when he told , i could only sleep when he told and till this day i ask how someone as so much control via webcam ? ? ? how ? ! they had pictures of me . . . videos . . . everything . i will not get into details . . . i am sorry i am not sure if i can . . . when i was 11 my family finally found the pictures and took me from her , they never told anyone . . . she was hospitalised at a psychiatric hospital for 9 months . i was so submissive that i asked to eat , asked to take a bath , asked to sleep and never looked anyone in the eyes . i could not sleep by myself , so i slept with my aunt and her husband . . . i was a burden because they had fights because of me . . they divorced each other 8 months later . when i was 14 , he found out our house phone number , i picked the phone not knowing who it was , when i heard him , i almost fainted because i had such a bad panic attack . and then , the photos were out for 24 hours ( me and my aunt were able to take it down ) , my whole school saw it and called me slut , spit in me , jumped on me so bad that i had to had back surgery 2 times in a period of 10 months . fast forward to 16 , they threw me out and i left in the middle of the night . i had to go back to her ( abuser ) because i had nowhere to go . she dislocated my collarbone , chocked me . the next year was awful . at 17 i said the i was gonna take a bath and put the water running , and i attempted suicide . she found me and slapped me 8 times and when she saw what i have done she call the ambulance . this was 2 days before my 18 birthday . i'm writing to much , anxiety , ptsd and tics are kicking in . . . i need to take a break .

" before i start , i’d like to say i’m not making excuses , just a combination of trauma and me being prone to extreme views was the perfect storm for some crazy stuff . this post mentions sexual assault , suicide , self harm and sexism . before i start i’d like to say i’m a woman , it’s relevant later . so , i was sexually abused as a child and didn’t even know how bad it was but i realized how bad it was when i was a teenager , as a child i didn’t even understand what was happening . i’m not going to say what happened because some sadist will probably enjoy reading it and also you don’t really want to know anyway . the person that abused me was an older woman who was a family friend , it was some pretty humiliating stuff but i wasn’t too physically harmed but the trauma messed me up . i was later diagnosed with cptsd . basically , i adopted the view that all women were sadistic creeps . since i’m a woman i hated myself to the point of wanting to die but i thought i deserved to suffer so i self harmed a lot to punish myself . to make it worse , i’m pretty much the stereotypical feminine person , both physically and emotionally . i’m not transgender but i tried wrapping bandages around my chest to look like a guy but it was uncomfortable and i just looked like a girl with a slightly flat chest . i brainwashed my little brother into becoming some crazed incel , that obviously turned him against me . i let myself be in an abusive relation in which i was slapped and degraded to the point of tears . you’re probably thinking , this girl is into some kinky stuff but i’m not , i just thought i deserved it . i hate myself for being like that . i ended up spending time in a psych ward , i still managed to self harm but i won’t say how because , to be frank , it’s disturbing and i don’t want to give anyone any ideas . i tried hanging out with other sexist creeps but since i’m a woman that obviously didn’t work , so i basically pretended to be a guy online and validated all the hateful stuff those creeps believed . to be honest , i’m probably going to be on ssris for my entire life and sometimes take klonopin but i now realize how wrong i was . i was so hurt and humiliated that it kind of drove me into madness . i guess the moral of the story is that people can change . i’m trying to undo the damaged relationship with my little brother . me being abused didn’t come out until later because i didn’t have a good relationship with my mother and i was uncomfortable telling my father about it and stuff . i’m not making excuses , i was wrong , and i feel so bad about it , but i’ve changed and accepted that it wasn’t my fault , i was an innocent kid . i just wanted to get that off my chest . also , i’m not begging for sympathy i just wanted to tell some people .

"you are a friend then , as i make it out , of our man shakespeare , who alone of us will put an ass's head in fairyland as he would add a shilling to more shillings , all most harmonious , — and out of his miraculous inviolable increase fills ilion , rome , or any town you like of olden time with timeless englishmen ; and i must wonder what you think of him — all you down there where your small avon flows by stratford , and where you are an alderman . some , for a guess , would have him riding back to be a farrier there , or say a dyer ; or maybe one of your adept surveyors ; or like enough the wizard of all tanners . not you — no fear of that ; for i discern in you a kindling of the flame that saves — the nimble element , the true caloric ; i see it , and was told of it , moreover , by our discriminate friend himself , no other . had you been one of the sad average , as he would have it , — meaning , as i take it , the sinew and the solvent of our island , you'd not be buying beer for this terpander's approved and estimated friend ben jonson ; he'd never foist it as a part of his contingent entertainment of a townsman while he goes off rehearsing , as he must , if he shall ever be the duke of stratford . and my words are no shadow on your town — far from it ; for one town's as like another as all are unlike london . oh , he knows it , — and there is the stratford in him ; he denies it , and there is the shakespeare in him . so , god help him ! i tell him he needs greek ; but neither god nor greek will help him . nothing will help that man . you see the fates have given him so much , he must have all or perish , — or look out of london , where he sees too many lords . they're part of half what ails him : i suppose there's nothing fouler down among the demons than what it is he feels when he remembers the dust and sweat and ointment of his calling with his lords looking on and laughing at him . king as he is , he cannot be king de facto , and that is as well , because he would not like it ; he'd frame a lower rating of men then than he has now ; and after that would come an abdication or an apoplexy . he cannot be king , not even king of stratford , — though half the world , if not the whole of it , may crown him with a crown that fits no king save lord apollo's homesick emissary : not there on avon , or on any stream where naiads and their white arms are no more , shall he find home again . it is all too bad . but there is a comfort , for he will have that house — the best you ever saw ; and he will be there anon , as you are an alderman . good god ! he makes me lie awake o'nights and laugh . and you have known him from his origin , you tell me ; and a most uncommon urchin he must have been to the few seeing ones — a trifle terrifying , i dare say , discovering a world with his man's eyes , quite as another lad might see some finches , if he looked hard and had an eye for nature . but this one had his eyes and their foretelling , and he had you to fare with , and what else ? he must have had a father and a mother — in fact i have heard him say so — and a dog , as a boy should , i venture ; and the dog , most likely , was the only man who knew him . a dog , for all i know , is what he needs as much as anything right here to - day , to counsel him about his disillusions , old aches , and parturitions of what is coming , — a dog of orders , an emeritus , to wag his tail at him when he comes home , and then to put his paws up on his knees and say , "" for god's sake , what is it all about ? "" i do not know whether he needs a dog or not — or what he needs . i tell him he needs greek ; i'll talk of rules and aristotle with him , and if his tongue's at home he will say to that , i have your word that aristotle knows , and you mine that i do not know aristotle . "" he's all at odds with all the unities , and what is yet worse , it does not seem to matter ; he treads along through time's old wilderness as if the tramp of all the centuries had left no roads — and there are none , for him ; he does not see them , even with those eyes , — and that is a pity , or i say it is . accordingly we have him as we have him — going his way , the way that he goes best , a pleasant animal with no great noise or nonsense anywhere to set him off — save only divers and inclement devils have made of late his heart their dwelling place . a flame half ready to fly out sometimes at some annoyance may be fanned up in him , but soon it falls , and when it falls goes out ; he knows how little room there is in there for crude and futile animosities , and how much for the joy of being whole , and how much for long sorrow and old pain . on our side there are some who may be given to grow old wondering what he thinks of us and some above us , who are , in his eyes , above himself , — and that is quite right and english . yet here we smile , or disappoint the gods who made it so : the gods have always eyes to see men scratch ; and they see one down here who itches , manor - bitten to the bone , albeit he knows himself — yes , yes , he knows — the lord of more than england and of more than all the seas of england in all time shall ever wash . d'ye wonder that i laugh ? he sees me , and he does not seem to care ; and why the devil should he ? i cannot tell you . i'll meet him out alone of a bright sunday , trim , rather spruce , and quite the gentleman . "" what ho , my lord ! "" say i . he does not hear me ; wherefore i have to pause and look at him . he's not enormous , but one looks at him . a little on the round if you insist , for now , god save the mark , he is growing old ; he's five and forty , and to hear him talk these days you would call him eighty ; then you would add more years to that . he is old enough to be the father of a world , and so he is . "" ben , you are a scholar , what is the time of day ? "" says he ; and there shines out of him again an aged light that has no age or station — the mystery that is his — a mischievous half - mad serenity that laughs at fame for being won so easy , and at friends who laugh at him for what he wants the most , and for his dukedom down in warwickshire ; — by which you see we are all a little jealous . . . poor greene ! i fear the color of his name was even as that of his ascending soul ; and he was one where there are many others , — some scrivening to the end against their fate , their puppets all in ink and all to die there ; and some with hands that once would shade an eye that scanned euripides and æschylus will reach by this time for a pot - house mop to slush their first and last of royalties . poor devils ! and they all play to his hand ; for so it was in athens and old rome . but that is not here or there ; i have wandered off . greene does it , or i am careful . where is that boy ? yes , he will go back to stratford . and we will miss him ? dear sir , there'll be no london here without him . we'll all be riding , one of these fine days , down there to see him — and his wife will not like us ; and then we will think of what he never said of women — which , if taken all in all with what he did say , would buy many horses . though nowadays he is not so much for women : "" so few of them , "" he says , "" are worth the guessing . "" but there is a worm at work when he says that , and while he says it one feels in the air a deal of circumambient hocus - pocus . they've had him dancing till his toes were tender , and he can feel 'em now , come chilly rains . there's no long cry for going into it , however , and we do not know much about it . but you in stratford , like most here in london , have more now in the sonnets than you paid for ; he's put one there with all her poison on , to make a singing fiction of a shadow that's in his life a fact , and always will be . but she is no care of ours , though time , i fear , will have a more reverberant ado about her than about another one who seems to have decoyed him , married him , and sent him scuttling on his way to london , — with much already learned , and more to learn , and more to follow . lord ! how i see him now , pretending , maybe trying , to be like us . whatever he may have meant , we never had him ; he failed us , or escaped , or what you will , — and there was that about him ( god knows what , — we'd flayed another had he tried it on us ) that made as many of us as had wits more fond of all his easy distances than one another's noise and clap - your - shoulder . but think you not , my friend , he would never talk ! talk ? he was eldritch at it ; and we listened — thereby acquiring much we knew before about ourselves , and hitherto had held irrelevant , or not prime to the purpose . and there were some , of course , and there be now , disordered and reduced amazedly to resignation by the mystic seal of young finality the gods had laid on everything that made him a young demon ; and one or two shot looks at him already as he had been their executioner ; and once or twice he was , not knowing it , — or knowing , being sorry for poor clay and saying nothing . . . yet , for all his engines , you'll meet a thousand of an afternoon who strut and sun themselves and see around 'em a world made out of more that has a reason than his , i swear , that he sees here to - day ; though he may scarcely give a fool an exit but we mark how he sees in everything a law that , given we flout it once too often , brings fire and iron down on our naked heads . to me it looks as if the power that made him , for fear of giving all things to one creature , left out the first , — faith , innocence , illusion , whatever 'tis that keeps us out o' bedlam , — and thereby , for his too consuming vision , empowered him out of nature ; though to see him , you'd never guess what is going on inside him . he'll break out some day like a keg of ale with too much independent frenzy in it ; and all for collaring what he knows will not keep , and what he would best forget — but that he can't . you'll have it , and have more than i am foretelling ; and there'll be such a roaring at the globe as never stunned the bleeding gladiators . he'll have to change the color of its hair a bit , for now he calls it cleopatra . black hair would never do for cleopatra . but you and i are not yet two old women , and you are a man of office . what he does is more to you than how it is he does it , — and that is what the lord god has never told him . they work together , and the devil helps 'em ; they do it of a morning , or if not , they do it of a night ; in which event he's peevish of a morning . he seems old ; he's not the proper stomach or the sleep — and they are two sovran agents to conserve him against the fiery art that has no mercy but what is in that prodigious grand new house . i gather something happening in his boyhood fulfilled him with a boy's determination to make all stratford 'ware of him . well , well , i hope at last he will have his joy of it , and all his pigs and sheep and bellowing beeves , and frogs and owls and unicorns , moreover , be less than hell to his attendant ears . oh , past a doubt we will all go down to see him . he may be wise . with london two days off , down there some wind of heaven may yet revive him ; but there is no quickening breath from anywhere small make of him again the poised young faun from warwickshire , who'd made , it seems , already a legend of himself before i came to blink before the last of his first lightning . whatever there be , there'll be no more of that ; the coming on of his old monster time has made him a still man ; and he has dreams were fair to think on once , and all found hollow . he knows how much of what men paint themselves would blister in the light of what they are ; he sees how much of what was great now shares an eminence transformed and ordinary ; he knows too much of what the world has hushed in others , to be loud now for himself ; he knows now at what height low enemies may reach his heart , and high friends let him fall ; but what not even such as he may know bedevils him the worst : his lark may sing at heaven's gate how he will , and for as long as joy may listen , but he sees no gate , save one whereat the spent clay waits a little before the churchyard has it , and the worm . not long ago , late in an afternoon , i came on him unseen down lambeth way , and on my life i was afear'd of him : he gloomed and mumbled like a soul from tophet , his hands behind him and his head bent solemn . "" what is it now , "" said i , — "" another woman ? "" that made him sorry for me , and he smiled . "" no , ben , "" he mused ; "" it's nothing . it is all nothing . we come , we go ; and when we are done , we are done . "" spiders and flies — we are mostly one or t'other — we come , we go ; and when we are done , we are done ; "" by god , you sing that song as if you knew it ! "" said i , by way of cheering him ; "" what ails ye ? "" "" i think i must have come down here to think , "" says he to that , and pulls his little beard ; "" your fly will serve as well as anybody , and what is his hour ? he flies , and flies , and flies , and in his fly's mind has a brave appearance ; and then your spider gets him in her net , and eats him out , and hangs him up to dry . that's nature , the kind mother of us all . and then your slattern housemaid swings her broom , and where is your spider ? and that is nature , also . it's nature , and it is nothing . it is all nothing . it's all a world where bugs and emperors go singularly back to the same dust , each in his time ; and the old , ordered stars that sang together , ben , will sing the same old stave to - morrow .

"1 . did your child lose acquired speech ? a fount and then silence . a none . an ellipse between — his breath through the seams of our windows . whistle of days . impossible bowl of a mouth — the open cupboard , vowels rounded up and swept under the rug . 2 . does your child produce unusual noises or infantile squeals ? he’d coo and we’d coo back . the sound passed back and forth between us like a ball . or later , an astral voice . some vibrato under the surface of us . the burst upon — burn of strings rubbed in a flourish . his exhausted face . 3 . is your child’s voice louder than required ? in an enclosure or a cave it is difficult to gauge one’s volume . the proscenium of the world . all the rooms we speak of are dark places . because he cannot see his mouth , he cannot imagine the sound that comes out . 4 . does your child speak frequent gibberish or jargon ? to my ears it is a language . every sound a system : the sound for dog or boy . the moan in his throat for water — that of a man with thirst . the dilapidated ladder that makes a sentence a sentence . this plosive is a verb . this liquid a want . we make symbols of his noise . 5 . does your child have difficulty understanding basic things ( “ just can’t get it ” ) ? against the backdrop of the tree he looks so small . 6 . does your child pull you around when he wants something ? by the sleeve . by the shirttail . his light touch hopscotching against my skin like sparrows . an insistence muscled and muscled again . 7 . does your child have difficulty expressing his needs or desires using gestures ? red - faced in the kitchen and in the bedroom and the yellow light touches his eyes which are open but not there . his eyes rest in their narrow boat dream and the canals are wide dividing this side from this side . 8 . is there no spontaneous initiation of speech or communication from your child ? when called he eases out of his body . his god is not our words nor is it the words from his lips . it is entirely body . so when he comes to us and looks we know there are beyond us impossible cylinders where meaning lives . 9 . does your child repeat heard words , parts of words , or tv commercials ? the mind circles the mind in the arena , far in — far in where the consonants touch and where the round chorus flaunts its iambs in a metronomic trot . humming to himself in warm and jugular songs . 10 . does your child use repetitive language ( same word or phrase over and over ) ? a pocket in his brain worries its ball of lint . a word clicks into its groove and stammers along its track , dopplering like a car with its windows rolled down and the one top hit of the summer angles its way into his brain . 11 . does your child have difficulty sustaining a conversation ? we could be anywhere , then the navel of the red moon drops its fruit . his world . this stained world drips its honey into our mouths . our words stolen from his malingering afternoon . 12 . does your child use monotonous speech or wrong pausing ? when the air is true and simple , we can watch him tremble for an hour , plucking his meaning from a handful of utterances and then ascend into the terrible partition of speech . 13 . does your child speak the same to kids , adults , or objects ( can’t differentiate ) ? because a reference needs a frame : we are mother and father and child with a world of time to be understood . the car radio plays its one song . the song , therefore , is important . it must be intoned at a rigorous time . because rigor is important and because the self insists on constant vigils . 14 . does your child use language inappropriately ( wrong words or phrases ) ? always , and he insists on the incorrect forms . the wrong word takes every form for love — the good tree leans into the pond , the gray dog’s ribs show , the memory bound to the window , and the promise of the radio playing its song on the hour . every wrong form is a form which represents us in our losses , if it takes us another world to understand .

"when awful darkness and silence reign over the great gromboolian plain , through the long , long wintry nights ; — when the angry breakers roar as they beat on the rocky shore ; — when storm - clouds brood on the towering heights of the hills of the chankly bore : — then , through the vast and gloomy dark , there moves what seems a fiery spark , a lonely spark with silvery rays piercing the coal - black night , — a meteor strange and bright : — hither and thither the vision strays , a single lurid light . slowly it wander , — pauses , — creeps , — anon it sparkles , — flashes and leaps ; and ever as onward it gleaming goes a light on the bong - tree stems it throws . and those who watch at that midnight hour from hall or terrace , or lofty tower , cry , as the wild light passes along , — "" the dong ! — the dong !

"" — and since that day he wanders still by lake and dorest , marsh and hills , singing — "" o somewhere , in valley or plain "" might i find my jumbly girl again ! "" for ever i will seek by lake and shore "" till i find my jumbly girl once more ! "" playing a pipe with silvery squeaks , since then his jumbly girl he seeks , and because by night he could not see , he gathered the bark of the twangum tree on the flowery plain that grows . and he wove him a wondrous nose , — a nose as strange as a nose could be ! of vast proportions and painted red , and tied with cords to the back of his head . — in a hollow rounded space it ended with a luminous lamp within suspended , all fenced about with a bandage stout to prevent the wind from blowing it out ; — and with holes all round to send the light , in gleaming rays on the dismal night . and now each night , and all night long , over those plains still roams the dong ; and above the wail of the chimp and snipe you may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe while ever he seeks , but seeks in vain to meet with his jumbly girl again ; lonely and wild — all night he goes , — the dong with a luminous nose ! and all who watch at the midnight hour , from hall or terrace , or lofty tower , cry , as they trace the meteor bright , moving along through the dreary night , — "" this is the hour when forth he goes , "" the dong with a luminous nose !

"i thought he was over - medicating himself and planning his suicide . i took the pills away from him . he looked defeated . he said as much . i felt sorry for both of us . his expressions held this enormity and a seared - exhausted center . spatial discomfort started to affect him but did not take hold till the next day , when he started to lose consciousness and rattled the house yelling about thieves , robbers , drunks , and pill - snatchers . we didn’t know what was going on : the tumor was rapidly metastasizing its mass through his cerebellum . his body became harder to manage and he sprung through the house with fear tugging violently at his bile duct tube . aja and i camped in the front rooms . the last night of intimacy , of lucidity — unbeknownst to me — we sat together huddled and i caressed him , cradling his arms , his legs , and his penis . i was sure we had time left for more , but this was the last time he spoke and searched my face and looked at me with a recognition i understood . it’s how we moved out of consciousness . i am haunted by those last days before we succumbed to hospice . i remember how stunning he was resting in bed — that week before , in our library with a cornflower blue - sheeted bed made by ashby and spider . in that bed , he had a look of wonder when we put movies on — he excited over wilson , the ball in castaway and stared unblinkingly at tom hanks . we giggled over this , and appreciated how andrew put the eno station on next , and aja lit and framed this sheeted bed with a twinkling lamp , an illuminant : bulbs he found soothing . we all watched him compose in the air to philip glass . i wished that we could have unleashed him to his afterlife then . that is what he would have wanted : a release to his own universe sonant and material , an ethereal ball . an awkward tom hanks , a wilson , and a castaway in a glittering hand - printed sea . this death sequence was the one i wanted for him .

there are so many nights in my life recently that just shows me how much i have missed out on . always looking for the next best thing or whatever else is out there has never let me enjoy the moment that i am in . i think about shooting myself in the mouth on a daily basis and i just do not think that is going away this time . i cannot do this every day and i do not want to . everyone can tell me that i should take a break and breathe and accept the inevitable and control what i can . sadly i do not care about that on such a regular basis . i think about my friends and my family and i still just do not care . i know it is selfish but i seriously wish that at some point in my life i could be selfish without affecting someone else . why does my life fall on anyone but me ? let me do what i want and end this where i see fit . does it get better ? i do not think it does and it only gets harder year after year . i am 26 now and would be very happy without keeping on . i am not even sure why i am posting this i just needed to get some of this off my mind and out there somewhere . i am not even looking for anything in response i just want someone to know how alone i feel on such a daily basis . . . ,1,,,2012

"it was the year we decided not to get divorced . the poem said something like clouds moving quickly across the sun while the rest of us talked about faith and how my personal level of intensity in faking it is one way to measure the depth of the drop i’d have to make before i could turn over in bed toward a window open to the night and spotty rain dotting leaves with light caught from porch lamps and know that what i’d imagined to be time drained of sound was the purest sound , one person turning away from another into a cone formed by his turning . we sat on the porch while the kids napped and watched light rise and fall through clouds moving quickly across the sun like distractions from a vital and complex truth that requires too many pages of exegesis for people with days like ours , time’s version of an optical illusion , both too long and too short for anything like actual thinking . i remember one of the many unsolicited pieces of advice we got when elmer was coming along — don’t make any major decisions until he’s one , you’ll be too tired to get it right . so naturally we changed jobs and moved across the country . i can’t even remember who gave us that advice . they’re probably out of our lives now . and what’s in them , these six and something years out of your forty and my almost that we’ve been spinning through together , watching our obligations mount around sensations that folded out of us from zones of our beings we hadn’t seen before , like a third arm you’d somehow failed to notice , an us both alien and uncannily us , children , a marriage , an unexpected love — these things have taken over , brushed aside whatever was there before like an anxious developer . this force is of our own making but comically has no regard for us , like that arm is a whole body , two bodies , tugging us along wherever they feel like going , the most dangerous places they can find . i was writing that line on my phone while following fifteen - month - old harlan doing his duck walk down a wheelchair ramp . he leaned way over the side of it to look at some smooth rocks on the ground and , as i got to the word “ dangerous , ” toppled down into them . so much for art , some might say , but not me , i just learned how many people have put videos online with the words “ spectacular sunset ” in their titles , there’s one after another . i’d made one myself , a video i mean , because the sun had ducked behind an unmoving cloud at the horizon , and i knew from the internet how long it would take the sun to reappear in the gap between the bottom edge of the cloud and the top edge of the earth , a sun - sized gap dotted with its own minor cloud variants there to complicate the image , a sun moving slowly behind clouds , and i felt a low note being struck within , something i’ve learned is not sadness but gratitude in unknowing , a feeling that is hard but porous , that dissipates like short rain steaming off its first idea of the ground . dark pink reformatting the blue , dark pink lights of our forever car , dark pink of hippies , dark pink life tassels , dark pink “ to fly , ” as you put it , “ by the night of our pants . ” i don’t know where the night goes , but i know we’ll be awake , and why , this long year of nights when people standing right next to us broke in half and spilled everywhere just because they paid attention . we don’t have an exact date for when we got engaged , there was no moment , no single question but instead weeks of them while an idea changed from something we could do into something we would , it was gestational , like this year has been , a year i hope is over . i’m glad you’re turning forty . i wish i were , too . i need a number for what we’ve come through , our second engagement , longer than the first , permanent , in fact , the questions of questions and the answer we give — give , deny , and give again .

"i'm afraid that my little sister , for some reason , will end up feeling the same as me . sometimes i let things slip , i unconsciously start talking about death because i cannot control myself , i just think about it all the time , it is impossible not to whisper "" god please kill me now , i would rather die "" when something goes wrong . i swear i try not to but i just let it out kinda jokingly ( and deep down i mean it ) . my sister is very attached to me and uses me as an example for everything , and sometimes i catch her making that kind of joke too . she has a very high self - esteem and that reassures me , but i also know that as she sees me as an example , if i had high self - esteem and was positive and strong and talked about how wonderful life is or some shit like that she would end up internalizing some of that the way she internalized those suicidal thought that she thinks is a joke but are actually what i really feel . i am afraid that one day she will end up suicidal like me , influenced by me in some way or simply because she is . i lose control sometimes and treat her rudely , so i know she doesn’t trust me much , so i’m afraid she doesn’t trust me to say she’s in trouble or sad , and i would feel horrible to know that i could be there for her but she did not trust me enough . i know that if i could open up to someone close to me , things would be easier , and i wish she had that . ngl these thoughts keep me up at night",1,,,3081

"nondum amabam , et amare amabam , quaerebam quid amarem , amans amare . — confess . st . august . earth , ocean , air , belovèd brotherhood ! if our great mother has imbued my soul with aught of natural piety to feel your love , and recompense the boon with mine ; if dewy morn , and odorous noon , and even , with sunset and its gorgeous ministers , and solemn midnight's tingling silentness ; if autumn's hollow sighs in the sere wood , and winter robing with pure snow and crowns of starry ice the grey grass and bare boughs ; if spring's voluptuous pantings when she breathes her first sweet kisses , have been dear to me ; if no bright bird , insect , or gentle beast i consciously have injured , but still loved and cherished these my kindred ; then forgive this boast , belovèd brethren , and withdraw no portion of your wonted favour now ! mother of this unfathomable world ! favour my solemn song , for i have loved thee ever , and thee only ; i have watched thy shadow , and the darkness of thy steps , and my heart ever gazes on the depth of thy deep mysteries . i have made my bed in charnels and on coffins , where black death keeps record of the trophies won from thee , hoping to still these obstinate questionings of thee and thine , by forcing some lone ghost thy messenger , to render up the tale of what we are . in lone and silent hours , when night makes a weird sound of its own stillness , like an inspired and desperate alchymist staking his very life on some dark hope , have i mixed awful talk and asking looks with my most innocent love , until strange tears uniting with those breathless kisses , made such magic as compels the charmèd night to render up thy charge : . . . and , though ne'er yet thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary , enough from incommunicable dream , and twilight phantasms , and deep noon - day thought , has shone within me , that serenely now and moveless , as a long - forgotten lyre suspended in the solitary dome of some mysterious and deserted fane , i wait thy breath , great parent , that my strain may modulate with murmurs of the air , and motions of the forests and the sea , and voice of living beings , and woven hymns of night and day , and the deep heart of man . there was a poet whose untimely tomb no human hands with pious reverence reared , but the charmed eddies of autumnal winds built o'er his mouldering bones a pyramid of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness : — a lovely youth , — no mourning maiden decked with weeping flowers , or votive cypress wreath , the lone couch of his everlasting sleep : — gentle , and brave , and generous , — no lorn bard breathed o'er his dark fate one melodious sigh : he lived , he died , he sung , in solitude . strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes , and virgins , as unknown he passed , have pined and wasted for fond love of his wild eyes . the fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn , and silence , too enamoured of that voice , locks its mute music in her rugged cell . by solemn vision , and bright silver dream , his infancy was nurtured . every sight and sound from the vast earth and ambient air , sent to his heart its choicest impulses . the fountains of divine philosophy fled not his thirsting lips , and all of great , or good , or lovely , which the sacred past in truth or fable consecrates , he felt and knew . when early youth had past , he left his cold fireside and alienated home to seek strange truths in undiscovered lands . many a wide waste and tangled wilderness has lured his fearless steps ; and he has bought with his sweet voice and eyes , from savage men , his rest and food . nature's most secret steps he like her shadow has pursued , where'er the red volcano overcanopies its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice with burning smoke , or where bitumen lakes on black bare pointed islets ever beat with sluggish surge , or where the secret caves rugged and dark , winding among the springs of fire and poison , inaccessible to avarice or pride , their starry domes of diamond and of gold expand above numberless and immeasurable halls , frequent with crystal column , and clear shrines of pearl , and thrones radiant with chrysolite . nor had that scene of ampler majesty than gems or gold , the varying roof of heaven and the green earth lost in his heart its claims to love and wonder ; he would linger long in lonesome vales , making the wild his home , until the doves and squirrels would partake from his innocuous hand his bloodless food , lured by the gentle meaning of his looks , and the wild antelope , that starts whene'er the dry leaf rustles in the brake , suspend her timid steps to gaze upon a form more graceful than her own . his wandering step obedient to high thoughts , has visited the awful ruins of the days of old : athens , and tyre , and balbec , and the waste where stood jerusalem , the fallen towers of babylon , the eternal pyramids , memphis and thebes , and whatsoe'er of strange sculptured on alabaster obelisk , or jasper tomb , or mutilated sphynx , dark æthiopia in her desert hills conceals . among the ruined temples there , stupendous columns , and wild images of more than man , where marble daemons watch the zodiac's brazen mystery , and dead men hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around , he lingered , poring on memorials of the world's youth , through the long burning day gazed on those speechless shapes , nor , when the moon filled the mysterious halls with floating shades suspended he that task , but ever gazed and gazed , till meaning on his vacant mind flashed like strong inspiration , and he saw the thrilling secrets of the birth of time . meanwhile an arab maiden brought his food , her daily portion , from her father's tent , and spread her matting for his couch , and stole from duties and repose to tend his steps : — enamoured , yet not daring for deep awe to speak her love : — and watched his nightly sleep , sleepless herself , to gaze upon his lips parted in slumber , whence the regular breath of innocent dreams arose : then , when red morn made paler the pale moon , to her cold home wildered , and wan , and panting , she returned . the poet wandering on , through arabie and persia , and the wild carmanian waste , and o'er the aërial mountains which pour down indus and oxus from their icy caves , in joy and exultation held his way ; till in the vale of cashmire , far within its loneliest dell , where odorous plants entwine beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower , beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched his languid limbs . a vision on his sleep there came , a dream of hopes that never yet had flushed his cheek . he dreamed a veilèd maid sate near him , talking in low solemn tones . her voice was like the voice of his own soul heard in the calm of thought ; its music long , like woven sounds of streams and breezes , held his inmost sense suspended in its web of many - coloured woof and shifting hues . knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme , and lofty hopes of divine liberty , thoughts the most dear to him , and poesy , herself a poet . soon the solemn mood of her pure mind kindled through all her frame a permeating fire : wild numbers then she raised , with voice stifled in tremulous sobs subdued by its own pathos : her fair hands were bare alone , sweeping from some strange harp strange symphony , and in their branching veins the eloquent blood told an ineffable tale . the beating of her heart was heard to fill the pauses of her music , and her breath tumultuously accorded with those fits of intermitted song . sudden she rose , as if her heart impatiently endured its bursting burthen : at the sound he turned , and saw by the warm light of their own life her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil of woven wind , her outspread arms now bare , her dark locks floating in the breath of night , her beamy bending eyes , her parted lips outstretched , and pale , and quivering eagerly . his strong heart sunk and sickened with excess of love . he reared his shuddering limbs and quelled his gasping breath , and spread his arms to meet her panting bosom : . . . she drew back a while , then , yielding to the irresistible joy , with frantic gesture and short breathless cry folded his frame in her dissolving arms . now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes , and night involved and swallowed up the vision ; sleep , like a dark flood suspended in its course rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain . roused by the shock he started from his trance — the cold white light of morning , the blue moon low in the west , the clear and garish hills , the distinct valley and the vacant woods , spread round him where he stood . whither have fled the hues of heaven that canopied his bower of yesternight ? the sounds that soothed his sleep , the mystery and the majesty of earth , the joy , the exultation ? his wan eyes gaze on the empty scene as vacantly as ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven . the spirit of sweet human love has sent a vision to the sleep of him who spurned her choicest gifts . he eagerly pursues beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade ; he overleaps the bounds . alas ! alas ! were limbs and breath and being intertwined thus treacherously ? lost , lost , for ever lost , in the wide pathless desert of dim sleep , that beautiful shape ! does the dark gate of death conduct to thy mysterious paradise , o sleep ? does the bright arch of rainbow clouds , and pendent mountains seen in the calm lake , lead only to a black and watery depth , while death's blue vault , with loathliest vapours hung , where every shade which the foul grave exhales hides its dead eye from the detested day , conduct , o sleep , to thy delightful realms ? this doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart , the insatiate hope which it awakened stung his brain even like despair . while daylight held the sky , the poet kept mute conference with his still soul . at night the passion came , like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream , and shook him from his rest , and led him forth into the darkness . — as an eagle grasped in folds of the green serpent , feels her breast burn with the poison , and precipitates through night and day , tempest , and calm , and cloud , frantic with dizzying anguish , her blind flight o'er the wide aëry wilderness : thus driven by the bright shadow of that lovely dream , beneath the cold glare of the desolate night , through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells , startling with careless step the moonlight snake , he fled . red morning dawned upon his flight , shedding the mockery of its vital hues upon his cheek of death . he wandered on till vast aornos , seen from petra's steep , hung o'er the low horizon like a cloud ; through balk , and where the desolated tombs of parthian kings scatter to every wind their wasting dust , wildly he wandered on , day after day a weary waste of hours , bearing within his life the brooding care that ever fed on its decaying flame . and now his limbs were lean ; his scattered hair sered by the autumn of strange suffering sung dirges in the wind ; his listless hand hung like dead bone within its withered skin ; life , and the lustre that consumed it , shone as in a furnace burning secretly from his dark eyes alone . the cottagers , who ministered with human charity his human wants , beheld with wondering awe their fleeting visitant . the mountaineer , encountering on some dizzy precipice that spectral form , deemed that the spirit of wind with lightning eyes , and eager breath , and feet disturbing not the drifted snow , had paused in its career : the infant would conceal his troubled visage in his mother's robe in terror at the glare of those wild eyes , to remember their strange light in many a dream of after - times ; but youthful maidens , taught by nature , would interpret half the woe that wasted him , would call him with false names brother , and friend , would press his pallid hand at parting , and watch , dim through tears , the path of his departure from their father's door . at length upon the lone chorasmian shore he paused , a wide and melancholy waste of putrid marshes . a strong impulse urged his steps to the sea - shore . a swan was there , beside a sluggish stream among the reeds . it rose as he approached , and with strong wings scaling the upward sky , bent its bright course high over the immeasurable main . his eyes pursued its flight . — "" thou hast a home , beautiful bird ; thou voyagest to thine home , where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck with thine , and welcome thy return with eyes bright in the lustre of their own fond joy . and what am i that i should linger here , with voice far sweeter than thy dying notes , spirit more vast than thine , frame more attuned to beauty , wasting these surpassing powers in the deaf air , to the blind earth , and heaven that echoes not my thoughts ? "" a gloomy smile of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips . for sleep , he knew , kept most relentlessly its precious charge , and silent death exposed , faithless perhaps as sleep , a shadowy lure , with doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms . startled by his own thoughts he looked around . there was no fair fiend near him , not a sight or sound of awe but in his own deep mind . a little shallop floating near the shore caught the impatient wandering of his gaze . it had been long abandoned , for its sides gaped wide with many a rift , and its frail joints swayed with the undulations of the tide . a restless impulse urged him to embark and meet lone death on the drear ocean's waste ; for well he knew that mighty shadow loves the slimy caverns of the populous deep . the day was fair and sunny : sea and sky drank its inspiring radiance , and the wind swept strongly from the shore , blackening the waves . following his eager soul , the wanderer leaped in the boat , he spread his cloak aloft on the bare mast , and took his lonely seat , and felt the boat speed o'er the tranquil sea like a torn cloud before the hurricane . as one that in a silver vision floats obedient to the sweep of odorous winds upon resplendent clouds , so rapidly along the dark and ruffled waters fled the straining boat . — a whirlwind swept it on , with fierce gusts and precipitating force , through the white ridges of the chafèd sea . the waves arose . higher and higher still their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempest's scourge like serpents struggling in a vulture's grasp . calm and rejoicing in the fearful war of wave ruining on wave , and blast on blast descending , and black flood on whirlpool driven with dark obliterating course , he sate : as if their genii were the ministers appointed to conduct him to the light of those belovèd eyes , the poet sate holding the steady helm . evening came on , the beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues high 'mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray that canopied his path o'er the waste deep ; twilight , ascending slowly from the east , entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks o'er the fair front and radiant eyes of day ; night followed , clad with stars . on every side more horribly the multitudinous streams of ocean's mountainous waste to mutual war rushed in dark tumult thundering , as to mock the calm and spangled sky . the little boat still fled before the storm ; still fled , like foam down the steep cataract of a wintry river ; now pausing on the edge of the riven wave ; now leaving far behind the bursting mass that fell , convulsing ocean . safely fled — as if that frail and wasted human form , had been an elemental god . at midnight the moon arose : and lo ! the ethereal cliffs of caucasus , whose icy summits shone among the stars like sunlight , and around whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves bursting and eddying irresistibly rage and resound for ever . — who shall save ? — the boat fled on , — the boiling torrent drove , — the crags closed round with black and jaggèd arms , the shattered mountain overhung the sea , and faster still , beyond all human speed , suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave , the little boat was driven . a cavern there yawned , and amid its slant and winding depths ingulfed the rushing sea . the boat fled on with unrelaxing speed . — "" vision and love ! "" the poet cried aloud , "" i have beheld the path of thy departure . sleep and death shall not divide us long ! "" the boat pursued the windings of the cavern . daylight shone at length upon that gloomy river's flow ; now , where the fiercest war among the waves is calm , on the unfathomable stream the boat moved slowly . where the mountain , riven , exposed those black depths to the azure sky , ere yet the flood's enormous volume fell even to the base of caucasus , with sound that shook the everlasting rocks , the mass filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm ; stair above stair the eddying waters rose , circling immeasurably fast , and laved with alternating dash the gnarlèd roots of mighty trees , that stretched their giant arms in darkness over it . i' the midst was left , reflecting , yet distorting every cloud , a pool of treacherous and tremendous calm . seized by the sway of the ascending stream , with dizzy swiftness , round , and round , and round , ridge after ridge the straining boat arose , till on the verge of the extremest curve , where , through an opening of the rocky bank , the waters overflow , and a smooth spot of glassy quiet mid those battling tides is left , the boat paused shuddering . — shall it sink down the abyss ? shall the reverting stress of that resistless gulf embosom it ? now shall it fall ? — a wandering stream of wind , breathed from the west , has caught the expanded sail , and , lo ! with gentle motion , between banks of mossy slope , and on a placid stream , beneath a woven grove it sails , and , hark ! the ghastly torrent mingles its far roar , with the breeze murmuring in the musical woods . where the embowering trees recede , and leave a little space of green expanse , the cove is closed by meeting banks , whose yellow flowers for ever gaze on their own drooping eyes , reflected in the crystal calm . the wave of the boat's motion marred their pensive task , which nought but vagrant bird , or wanton wind , or falling spear - grass , or their own decay had e'er disturbed before . the poet longed to deck with their bright hues his withered hair , but on his heart its solitude returned , and he forbore . not the strong impulse hid in those flushed cheeks , bent eyes , and shadowy frame had yet performed its ministry : it hung upon his life , as lightning in a cloud gleams , hovering ere it vanish , ere the floods of night close over it . the noonday sun now shone upon the forest , one vast mass of mingling shade , whose brown magnificence a narrow vale embosoms . there , huge caves scooped in the dark base of their aëry rocks mocking its moans , respond and roar for ever . the meeting boughs and implicated leaves wove twilight o'er the poet's path , as led by love , or dream , or god , or mightier death , he sought in nature's dearest haunt , some bank her cradle , and his sepulchre . more dark and dark the shades accumulate . the oak , expanding its immense and knotty arms , embraces the light beech . the pyramids of the tall cedar overarching , frame most solemn domes within , and far below , like clouds suspended in an emerald sky , the ash and the acacia floating hang tremulous and pale . like restless serpents , clothed in rainbow and in fire , the parasites , starred with ten thousand blossoms , flow around the grey trunks , and , as gamesome infants' eyes , with gentle meanings , and most innocent wiles , fold their beams round the hearts of those that love , these twine their tendrils with the wedded boughs uniting their close union ; the woven leaves make net - work of the dark blue light of day , and the night's noontide clearness , mutable as shapes in the weird clouds . soft mossy lawns beneath these canopies extend their swells , fragrant with perfumed herbs , and eyed with blooms minute yet beautiful . one darkest glen sends from its woods of musk - rose , twined with jasmine , a soul - dissolving odour , to invite to some more lovely mystery . through the dell , silence and twilight here , twin - sisters , keep their noonday watch , and sail among the shades , like vaporous shapes half seen ; beyond , a well , dark , gleaming , and of most translucent wave , images all the woven boughs above , and each depending leaf , and every speck of azure sky , darting between their chasms ; nor aught else in the liquid mirror laves its portraiture , but some inconstant star between one foliaged lattice twinkling fair , or painted bird , sleeping beneath the moon , or gorgeous insect floating motionless , unconscious of the day , ere yet his wings have spread their glories to the gaze of noon . hither the poet came . his eyes beheld their own wan light through the reflected lines of his thin hair , distinct in the dark depth of that still fountain ; as the human heart , gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave , sees its own treacherous likeness there . he heard the motion of the leaves , the grass that sprung startled and glanced and trembled even to feel an unaccustomed presence , and the sound of the sweet brook that from the secret springs of that dark fountain rose . a spirit seemed to stand beside him — clothed in no bright robes of shadowy silver or enshrining light , borrowed from aught the visible world affords of grace , or majesty , or mystery ; — but , undulating woods , and silent well , and leaping rivulet , and evening gloom now deepening the dark shades , for speech assuming , held commune with him , as if he and it were all that was , — only . . . when his regard was raised by intense pensiveness , . . . two eyes , two starry eyes , hung in the gloom of thought , and seemed with their serene and azure smiles to beckon him . obedient to the light that shone within his soul , he went , pursuing the windings of the dell . — the rivulet wanton and wild , through many a green ravine beneath the forest flowed . sometimes it fell among the moss , with hollow harmony dark and profound . now on the polished stones it danced ; like childhood laughing as it went : then , through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept , reflecting every herb and drooping bud that overhung its quietness . — "" o stream ! whose source is inaccessibly profound , whither do thy mysterious waters tend ? thou imagest my life . thy darksome stillness , thy dazzling waves , thy loud and hollow gulfs , thy searchless fountain , and invisible course have each their type in me : and the wide sky , and measureless ocean may declare as soon what oozy cavern or what wandering cloud contains thy waters , as the universe tell where these living thoughts reside , when stretched upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste i' the passing wind ! "" beside the grassy shore of the small stream he went ; he did impress on the green moss his tremulous step , that caught strong shuddering from his burning limbs . as one roused by some joyous madness from the couch of fever , he did move ; yet , not like him , forgetful of the grave , where , when the flame of his frail exultation shall be spent , he must descend . with rapid steps he went beneath the shade of trees , beside the flow of the wild babbling rivulet ; and now the forest's solemn canopies were changed for the uniform and lightsome evening sky . grey rocks did peep from the spare moss , and stemmed the struggling brook : tall spires of windlestrae threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope , and nought but gnarlèd roots of ancient pines branchless and blasted , clenched with grasping roots the unwilling soil . a gradual change was here , yet ghastly . for , as fast years flow away , the smooth brow gathers , and the hair grows thin and white , and where irradiate dewy eyes had shone , gleam stony orbs : — so from his steps bright flowers departed , and the beautiful shade of the green groves , with all their odorous winds and musical motions . calm , he still pursued the stream , that with a larger volume now rolled through the labyrinthine dell ; and there fretted a path through its descending curves with its wintry speed . on every side now rose rocks , which , in unimaginable forms , lifted their black and barren pinnacles in the light of evening , and its precipice obscuring the ravine , disclosed above , mid toppling stones , black gulfs and yawning caves , whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues to the loud stream . lo ! where the pass expands its stony jaws , the abrupt mountain breaks , and seems , with its accumulated crags , to overhang the world : for wide expand beneath the wan stars and descending moon islanded seas , blue mountains , mighty streams , dim tracts and vast , robed in the lustrous gloom of leaden - coloured even , and fiery hills mingling their flames with twilight , on the verge of the remote horizon . the near scene , in naked and severe simplicity , made contrast with the universe . a pine , rock - rooted , stretched athwart the vacancy its swinging boughs , to each inconstant blast yielding one only response , at each pause , in most familiar cadence , with the howl the thunder and the hiss of homeless streams mingling its solemn song , whilst the broad river , foaming and hurrying o'er its rugged path , fell into that immeasurable void , scattering its waters to the passing winds . yet the grey precipice and solemn pine and torrent , were not all ; — one silent nook was there . even on the edge of that vast mountain , upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks , it overlooked in its serenity the dark earth , and the bending vault of stars . it was a tranquil spot , that seemed to smile even in the lap of horror . ivy clasped the fissured stones with its entwining arms , and did embower with leaves for ever green , and berries dark , the smooth and even space of its inviolated floor , and here the children of the autumnal whirlwind bore , in wanton sport , those bright leaves , whose decay , red , yellow , or ethereally pale , rivals the pride of summer . 'tis the haunt of every gentle wind , whose breath can teach the wilds to love tranquillity . one step , one human step alone , has ever broken the stillness of its solitude : — one voice alone inspired its echoes ; — even that voice which hither came , floating among the winds , and led the loveliest among human forms to make their wild haunts the depository of all the grace and beauty that endued its motions , render up its majesty , scatter its music on the unfeeling storm , and to the damp leaves and blue cavern mould , nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss , commit the colours of that varying cheek , that snowy breast , those dark and drooping eyes . the dim and hornèd moon hung low , and poured a sea of lustre on the horizon's verge that overflowed its mountains . yellow mist filled the unbounded atmosphere , and drank wan moonlight even to fulness : not a star shone , not a sound was heard ; the very winds , danger's grim playmates , on that precipice slept , clasped in his embrace . — o , storm of death ! whose sightless speed divides this sullen night : and thou , colossal skeleton , that , still guiding its irresistible career in thy devastating omnipotence , art king of this frail world , from the red field of slaughter , from the reeking hospital , the patriot's sacred couch , the snowy bed of innocence , the scaffold and the throne , a mighty voice invokes thee . ruin calls his brother death . a rare and regal prey he hath prepared , prowling around the world ; glutted with which thou mayst repose , and men go to their graves like flowers or creeping worms , nor ever more offer at thy dark shrine the unheeded tribute of a broken heart . when on the threshold of the green recess the wanderer's footsteps fell , he knew that death was on him . yet a little , ere it fled , did he resign his high and holy soul to images of the majestic past , that paused within his passive being now , like winds that bear sweet music , when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber . he did place his pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk of the old pine . upon an ivied stone reclined his languid head , his limbs did rest , diffused and motionless , on the smooth brink of that obscurest chasm ; — and thus he lay , surrendering to their final impulses the hovering powers of life . hope and despair , the torturers , slept ; no mortal pain or fear marred his repose , the influxes of sense , and his own being unalloyed by pain , yet feebler and more feeble , calmly fed the stream of thought , till he lay breathing there at peace , and faintly smiling : — his last sight was the great moon , which o'er the western line of the wide world her mighty horn suspended , with whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed to mingle . now upon the jaggèd hills it rests , and still as the divided frame of the vast meteor sunk , the poet's blood , that ever beat in mystic sympathy with nature's ebb and flow , grew feebler still : and when two lessening points of light alone gleamed through the darkness , the alternate gasp of his faint respiration scarce did stir the stagnate night : — till the minutest ray was quenched , the pulse yet lingered in his heart . it paused — it fluttered . but when heaven remained utterly black , the murky shades involved an image , silent , cold , and motionless , as their own voiceless earth and vacant air . even as a vapour fed with golden beams that ministered on sunlight , ere the west eclipses it , was now that wondrous frame — no sense , no motion , no divinity — a fragile lute , on whose harmonious strings the breath of heaven did wander — a bright stream once fed with many - voicèd waves — a dream of youth , which night and time have quenched for ever , still , dark , and dry , and unremembered now . o , for medea's wondrous alchemy , which wheresoe'er it fell made the earth gleam with bright flowers , and the wintry boughs exhale from vernal blooms fresh fragrance ! o , that god , profuse of poisons , would concede the chalice which but one living man has drained , who now , vessel of deathless wrath , a slave that feels no proud exemption in the blighting curse he bears , over the world wanders for ever , lone as incarnate death ! o , that the dream of dark magician in his visioned cave , raking the cinders of a crucible for life and power , even when his feeble hand shakes in its last decay , were the true law of this so lovely world ! but thou art fled like some frail exhalation ; which the dawn robes in its golden beams , — ah ! thou hast fled ! the brave , the gentle , and the beautiful , the child of grace and genius . heartless things are done and said i' the world , and many worms and beasts and men live on , and mighty earth from sea and mountain , city and wilderness , in vesper low or joyous orison , lifts still its solemn voice : — but thou art fled — thou canst no longer know or love the shapes of this phantasmal scene , who have to thee been purest ministers , who are , alas ! now thou art not . upon those pallid lips so sweet even in their silence , on those eyes that image sleep in death , upon that form yet safe from the worm's outrage , let no tear be shed — not even in thought . nor , when those hues are gone , and those divinest lineaments , worn by the senseless wind , shall live alone in the frail pauses of this simple strain , let not high verse , mourning the memory of that which is no more , or painting's woe or sculpture , speak in feeble imagery their own cold powers . art and eloquence , and all the shows o' the world are frail and vain to weep a loss that turns their lights to shade . it is a woe too "" deep for tears , "" when all is reft at once , when some surpassing spirit , whose light adorned the world around it , leaves those who remain behind , not sobs or groans , the passionate tumult of a clinging hope ; but pale despair and cold tranquillity , nature's vast frame , the web of human things , birth and the grave , that are not as they were .

"this is a long story . i don’t know what to do or where to start . there is so much . i will start with the fact that my mother was never empathetic towards me or my little brother . she ruined my father emotionally and then moved onto a pedophile who was around me when i was young . then after he went to jail she moved onto a manipulative sociopath when i was very young . he would constantly abuse me , treat me like his personal slave , call me names ( including gay and fat ) and more that i care not to remember anymore . when i was 15 i had started smoking weed ( very minimal , dare i say “ weed virgin ” amounts ) and when my moms boyfriend found it he basically painted me as a drug dealer / addict to my family . i was kicked out at 16 and moved in with my father who at the time had turned to crack and meth . his house was basically a crackhouse and i had many of my things stolen , and i slept with a knife . eventually , after a few months of living there , we got into a fist fight because he had bad hallucinations on molly and decided that i was turning against him . i moved back in with my mother for a couple months but everything went south very quickly . very soon i was back out again and had to go back to my dads crackhouse . while i was living there he continued to pay my mother child support which drove him mad . he quit his job and started renting rooms to his meth head friends . i was not going to stick around so i started couch surfing . i finished high school while i stayed with a friend i still hold dear to this day . i don’t talk to him enough but he helped me for sure . eventually the family i was staying with tried to mend things between me and my mother and i moved in with her once again . except this time she no longer lived in toronto , she moved to ottawa . my little brother had grown up so much , i basically missed growing up with him . everything was okay until things started getting sketchy again with the sociopathic boyfriend . he deeply convinced everyone in my family that i was a massive drug dealer . i left before things got heated and moved in with my grandmother back in toronto . the night that i got down there i started getting nasty violent texts from my little brother . turns out the sociopathic boyfriend had lied to him saying that i was selling his belongings on kijiji and i was somehow out to get my mom . things didn’t last very long at my grandmothers as she was convinced that i was dealing drugs out of her house because she found a quarter ounce of pot . i was back to couch surfing . by now i was 22 and had put in years of labour from bosses who took advantage of me - because i couldn’t get anything else ; i had to survive . i had a broken rib from work that i had been working with for 3 months because my dumbass doctor thought it was a pulled muscle , and no help from anybody . even ei gave me months of trouble when i applied for it because i couldn’t prove i broke it at work . slowly my friends started turning against me and showing their true colours . i gave it one last shot to try to make my mom come to her senses by publicly shaming her on facebook and tagging her friends . she told me to come home . she told me she was sorry . she told me she loved me for the first time . i moved back in with her for 2 weeks . within those 2 weeks i had learned that the sociopathic boyfriend still had the $ 1000 guitar i bought at 14 that he stole from me , and that he had been lying to my little brother to turn him against me . while i was there for 2 weeks he would not even try to test me because he knew that his stay was coming to an end . the last day that i was there my mother blew up on him and told him to get a job . he left for 2 hours and while he was gone i exposed everything he had done to me - to my little brother and my mother . when he got back i made him open up a closet that he always had locked and it turns out he was growing weed in my mother’s house without her knowledge while i was kicked out . he was also receiving my gst credits by cheque and keeping them in a drawer after opening them . ( while i was in toronto sealing with a broken rib and no income ) i made him tremble . i screamed and almost got physical but he cowered away so i didn’t have to crunch him . he was told that night to get out . the next day my mother had done a 180 and was now back on his side . i ripped open his door and told him to get out . i swear to god i was about to pull a knife and cut his throat but my mom picked up the phone and called 911 . me and my little brother left and we have not been back since . the police phoned me and i explained everything to them . little bitches acted like children when they heard the truth and left me alone . they still haven’t done anything about my government cheque’s illegally being opened and my stuff being stolen - and that my mother was evading taxes by renting out my room while i was gone . ( she is a cra agent ) it has been 3 months , i now struggle alone with my crippled body to support my brother and he started a seasonal construction job at the beginning of the month . i don’t think i can handle much more . my rib never was given a chance to heal and i have a hard time breathing . i can’t do this anymore . my car is breaking down and i have less than $ 5 in my bank account . nobody in my family will help me and i have no friends . i am so alone . i want to die . edit : check engine light came on this morning and i was ready . i went to the hospital but anxiety pills can’t fix this .

"it is not the first time , but the idea of committing suicide has ceased to be a joke and has become a reality for me . i am 25 years old , i cannot complain about my childhood , even though i have problems never solved with the man who assumed the father figure for me , since my father left me when i was 5 years old . however , somehow i believe that my childhood , which is divided between the bad relationship with this man and the excess of care and affection for other members of my family , turned me into an adult unable to stand on my own . currently , i have a large part of everything i ever dreamed of . i have been dating a wonderful person for almost 10 years , even though we only see each other on the weekends , i have a good car , enough money to feed me well , maintain small luxuries and have some kind of fun . and more recently , i fulfilled the dream of getting a public job , which in my country means the most stable type of job you can get , since it is very difficult for you to get fired in that position . i have been selected through an exam in which ive competed with + 5000 ppl , and now i am working at this new job , 200km far from my hometown . and when i thought i was entering the happiest period of my life , problems got worse . i was put to work in one of the worst departments among the possible ones , dealing directly with other workers payments , with great responsibility and problems that do not depend only on me to be solved . the pressure on me is high , and i was put in place of another employee who was in that position before , and since he cannot be fired , he was placed in another department . this person visibly wants me to get screwed , wants me to do something wrong and makes it clear that he does not like me . whenever possible , this person tries to hinder my work . this , added to the daily stress of the workplace , has been draining my energy . i took a leadership position , where i need to make decisions on my own about things i have never done before , and i am terrified of doing something wrong . i have a lot of anxiety , fear of making mistakes in my work , fear of commiting serious mistakes that could justify my dismissal , etc . whenever a problem arises at work , i have anxiety attacks , i cannot reason properly and i feel an overwhelming desire to force my move to another workplace - which , in turn , can put me in a bad situation with my superiors . today i am here , in a city 200km far from where i grew up , away from my family , in my own home , where i thought i would live the happiest period of my life , thinking about taking my own life because i cannot stand the stress of work . on the one hand , when talking to my colleagues and immediate superiors , i realize that i may be exaggerating , and that everyone is seeing my effort and good faith . on the other , the fear of being boycotted , harmed in some way is literally killing me . i am ashamed to think about taking my life , but i cannot help thinking . i do not expect anyone to read this until the end , but if anyone does , i would appreciate any word . i needed to get it off my chest .

"someone must have seen an old dog dragging its broken body through the wet grass ; someone should have known it was lost , drinking from the old well , then lifting its head to the wind off the bottoms , and someone might have wanted that dog trailing its legs along the ground like vines sliding up the creek searching for sun ; but they were not there when the dog wandered through turley’s woods looking for food and stopped beneath the thorn trees and wrapped its tail around its nose until it was covered by falling leaves that piled up and up until there was no lost dog at all to hear the distant voice calling through the timber , only a tired heart breathing slower , and breath , soft as mist , above the leaves .

"we had been married for six or seven years when my wife , standing in the kitchen one afternoon , told me that she screams underwater when she swims — that , in fact , she has been screaming for years into the blue chlorinated water of the community pool where she does laps every other day . buttering her toast , not as if she had been concealing anything , not as if i should consider myself personally the cause of her screaming , nor as if we should perform an act of therapy right that minute on the kitchen table , — casually , she told me , and i could see her turn her square face up to take a gulp of oxygen , then down again into the cold wet mask of the unconscious . for all i know , maybe everyone is screaming as they go through life , silently , politely keeping the big secret that it is not all fun to be ripped by the crooked beak of something called psychology , to be dipped down again and again into time ; that the truest , most intimate pleasure you can sometimes find is the wet kiss of your own pain . there goes kath , at one pm , to swim her twenty - two laps back and forth in the community pool ; — what discipline she has ! twenty - two laps like twenty - two pages , that will never be read by anyone .

"my memory is still hazy of it . i remember finding a new song that spoke deeply to me , i set it on loop . listened to it endlessly through the evening . i drank heavily that night more then usual , i guess i just needed a courage boost for the thing i have been wanting for so long . i played some games with some friends i told them i loved them a few times . after they decided they needed sleep i decided to go outside . it was a beautiful night there was a gentle breeze and the fresh autumn air was relaxing . i felt so alone in this life surrounded by people who only caused me harm . i wept most for my cat , he was the only thing that could make me smile . i did not want him to feel the same way i did when i was gone . through my years of abuse growing up he was the only thing that made me feel okay he was my best friend . no matter how much i thought i wanted it there was always that small part of me that wanted to live crying out . i was able to ignore it this time thanks to the liquor . as i sealed my fate . there was this instant regret my heart sinking to my stomach feeling . i thought what could i have done to avoid being here is this really what i wanted why did not anyone love me ? i became at peace with it rather quickly . i felt so tranquil and at peace i have never felt such a way before . i imagine it was the large amount of xanex causing most of that but still . i woke up in a hospital and was forced to deal with my actions . i do not remember a whole lot in that moment . i do remember the first 2 or 3 days i had trouble walking . they said i had stopped breathing a few times but we are able to bring me back . i faded in and out of consciousness a few times and i was hallucinating quite a bit . it is been 2 years since that day and i still struggle with those thoughts . nothings improved but i have decided to stay a bit longer to hold on until i have explored every option and see if i missed anything right in front of me . i pray that one day i will find it .

"belfast , winter , 1976 when we stop where you lived , the house has thickened , the entry level to the wall with bricks , as though it could keep you out . again the dream has fooled you into waking and we have walked out past ourselves , through the windows to be remembered in the light of closed rooms as a series of impositions across the arms of a chair , that woman’s face startled out of us so it lingers along a brick front . you are leading me back to the burned arcade where you said i stood with you in your childhood last night , your childhood which includes me now as surely as the look of that missing face between the rows of houses . we have gone so far into your past that nothing reflects us . no sun gleams from the glassless frame where a room burned , though the house stayed whole . there is your school , your church , the place you drank cider at lunch time . new rows of houses are going up . children play quietly in a stairwell . walking back , you tell the story of the sniper’s bullet making two clean holes in the taxi , how the driver ducked and drove on like nothing happened . no pain passed through you ; it did not even stop the car or make you live more carefully . near the check point we stop talking , you let the hands rub your clothes against your body . you seem to be there , all there . watching , i am more apart for the sign of dismissal they will give me , thinking a woman would not conceal as i have , the perfect map of this return where i have met and lost you willingly in a dead and living place . now when you find me next in the dream , this boundary will move with us . we will both come back .

"let me start this off by saying that i am a horrible person . i know the first reaction of anyone , when they hear this is to fight it , but it is true . i have thought about this for a long time , and honestly and the only conclusion that i can come to is that the longer i go on living the worse i make the world . every day that i continue to live is a day without justice . i’m scared of what the future holds and honestly i don’t know if i’m strong enough to face it . how the fuck am i supposed to live for decades more when i can’t even live well right now . i am in the easiest part of my life , a life that has been made extremely easy by my parents and friends and yet somehow i can’t succeed at anything . i have never been able to accomplish anything of note in my life . who has ever heard about someone that could fail so badly when the odds were so much in their favor . this isn’t just a one time thing but the theme of my life . the odds align for me to do well , and in the end i drop the ball . whether that be in real life , or even video games i can’t seem to justify my existence . while my successes are non - existent my list of failures extend beyond the horizon . everything i do is failure . a piece of evidence that builds upon the conclusion that the only thing i deserve is buckshot through the back of my skull , that is if i deserve such a peaceful death . the only thing that i could possibly succeed at that would have any sort of good impact on the world is if i killed myself , but even that may be a failure . even if i do succeed in ending my life , how do i know if my death was painful enough . i know that i deserve to die , but in what way ? should i set myself on fire ? would i be able to ? however if i let the method of my death confound me , then i don’t actually end up killing myself which is a sin much worse than me dying without suffering enough . i guess it is a compromise . i have tried to make myself suffer by self - harming but that probably isn’t enough , what is a few scrapes and drops of blood in the long run anyway . maybe the pain that i won’t be alive to cause will be enough payment . saving thirty dollars is pretty similar to earning thirty dollars after all , so maybe by making it so that i can’t hurt anyone anymore i will be paying my pain deficit . but that only happens if i succeed in killing myself something that is antithetical to my entire existence . i guess i will just have to hope that jumping off that bridge will be my first success , i have failed many times before , but people say that you should try again . so i guess i will take their advice .

"hello , 24 ( m ) here . i don’t think i can live the rest of my life thinking i’m worthy of love and / or ever being in a long term happy relationship because it makes me so fucking hopeless . i am obese and have a really small member . to make matters worst , i had lost all the weight before but gained it all back and more because thinking my size would make me unlovable so what was the point of trying to have a nice body . i also hate how great of a personality i have . i know that doesn’t make sense and may sound arrogant but i’m always constantly told about how great of a friend i am , how great of a person i am . all my friends see me as someone funny , kind , empathetic , etc . i have close friends that i mean a lot to them . but what’s the point of being so great when physically i am the worst type of man . when i have lived my life giving up on love , i feel okay . i understand that life holds more gifts than love even though that may be the greatest gift . i love watching anime and playing video games and hanging out with my friends . i don’t love my job and have no idea what i want to do but that doesn’t bother me . when i think about love is when i get so damn depressed . i ignored it for years until now . to make things even more worse , i’m actually talking to someone who i went to school in the past but never talked and hadn’t seen in years . she has no clue how i look now and we’ve been talking for 6 months . we talked strictly through the phone and through text and snap where i can show parts of my face . she’s fallen in love with me strictly through my personality and voice . this wasn’t my intention at all . i was just her friend who genuinely cared for her and would talk to her everyday . one day she got drunk and told me she liked me and it was crazy because she had never even talked to me , held me , kissed me etc . over the course of a few months , she has told she loves me unconditionally and doesn’t care about anything physical . i’ve put off seeing her in person for months know while i’ve been secretly working out to at least not be obese . i’ve lost a lot of weight before super quickly so i’m confident that i can lose it again . i told her she would see me at the end of this year . she has been so supportive of me , and always encourages me . she’s always saying how much she loves me and that this love is pure and unconditional cause we’ve never even held hands . she says that she will always wait for me and that she will never give up on me . i’ve told her time and time again , that i’m unlovable , no women would want me , and that loving me is a mistake and waste of time . also , i am pretty sure she knows about my size issue because she’s brought it up before while being drunk , and she has talked in a way that could let me know she knows why i think i’m unlovable . she still calls me every day and night and we talk for hours . even when we were just friends , we would talk constantly . i’ve told her i’ve had suicidal thoughts and that i’m only gonna disappoint her . but no matter what i say , she always tell me she would love me no matter what ( even if i was a burn victim , weighed 400 pounds , had no legs , had ms , etc etc ) and that i’m the best thing to have happen to her . but i also think she thinks that because she does not know who i look or about my size . she says she loves me for me and nothing else . i do plan on telling her everything when i see her in person . for now we’re best friends who love each other a lot . i’m also working out and have lost about 50 pounds in 3 months . i’m now at 315 and confident i could reach 240ish by the end of the year . she deserves someone who isn’t morbidly obese . i love her to death even when i also haven’t held her in my arms . she gives me hope and motivates me to become a better person . it’s just hard for me to really think she can love me when she knows all of me . what do i do ? should i end things now ? should i have hope ? i’ve been broken up before by girls who have told me they loved me but couldn’t deal with my member . when i think about that too much , i think about the pain and how maybe dying would be better off for me .

"1 . after dark , stars glisten like ice , and the distance they span hides something elemental . not god , exactly . more like some thin - hipped glittering bowie - being — a starman or cosmic ace hovering , swaying , aching to make us see . and what would we do , you and i , if we could know for sure that someone was there squinting through the dust , saying nothing is lost , that everything lives on waiting only to be wanted back badly enough ? would you go then , even for a few nights , into that other life where you and that first she loved , blind to the future once , and happy ? would i put on my coat and return to the kitchen where my mother and father sit waiting , dinner keeping warm on the stove ? bowie will never die . nothing will come for him in his sleep or charging through his veins . and he’ll never grow old , just like the woman you lost , who will always be dark - haired and flush - faced , running toward an electronic screen that clocks the minutes , the miles left to go . just like the life in which i’m forever a child looking out my window at the night sky thinking one day i’ll touch the world with bare hands even if it burns . 2 . he leaves no tracks . slips past , quick as a cat . that’s bowie for you : the pope of pop , coy as christ . like a play within a play , he’s trademarked twice . the hours plink past like water from a window a / c . we sweat it out , teach ourselves to wait . silently , lazily , collapse happens . but not for bowie . he cocks his head , grins that wicked grin . time never stops , but does it end ? and how many lives before take - off , before we find ourselves beyond ourselves , all glam - glow , all twinkle and gold ? the future isn’t what it used to be . even bowie thirsts for something good and cold . jets blink across the sky like migratory souls . 3 . bowie is among us . right here in new york city . in a baseball cap and expensive jeans . ducking into a deli . flashing all those teeth at the doorman on his way back up . or he’s hailing a taxi on lafayette as the sky clouds over at dusk . he’s in no rush . doesn’t feel the way you’d think he feels . doesn’t strut or gloat . tells jokes . i’ve lived here all these years and never seen him . like not knowing a comet from a shooting star . but i’ll bet he burns bright , dragging a tail of white - hot matter the way some of us track tissue back from the toilet stall . he’s got the whole world under his foot , and we are small alongside , though there are occasions when a man his size can meet your eyes for just a blip of time and send a thought like shine shine shine shine shine straight to your mind . bowie , i want to believe you . want to feel your will like the wind before rain . the kind everything simply obeys , swept up in that hypnotic dance as if something with the power to do so had looked its way and said : go ahead .

"dropouts mace had the kind of courage you could easily mistake for brawn . i don’t know why i call it courage . sure , he stood up to greasers . and didn’t visibly fret on the days when his report card made hard fact of what was already apparent from his absences . yet mace was gifted with an uninflected quickness , a fine intelligence of his own despair , a knowledge — as he gunned the engine of his once white ’58 chevy , with a four - on - the - floor he’d installed himself , to climb higher into the hills above the city — of where nowhere was … light shadow cutting brusquely across the canyons — * like everyone else in our class , mace was a year older than me . he had stubble on his chin . i dragged a razor up and down my cheeks to inspire fast , early growth . “ don’t shave your jowls , ” friends warned , knowing i overdid everything , “ or you’ll grow hair there later . ” later was a word i disdained , its insistence on the future tense , postponement — life on the back burner . * mace seemed incapable of worry . his coolness and insouciance made girls stare . he was always brushing back the shock of raven - black hair that fell over his right eyebrow . the same teacher who sent me lickety split to the principal’s office would lean over mace’s desk and whisper warmly , compassionately in his ear . they would nod together . i could fill in every blank . “ what’s the matter richard ? ” “ nothing . ” “ if you’re having trouble , ” this is where the whispering grew most intense , “ i want you to feel you can talk to me as a friend . your work in class is so good , you have so much ability , richard … ” mace would never protest , never defend himself . indignation was a country where he’d never been . “ you may hate me , ” i thought , praying she would not double the insult of the absence of her concern for me with a glance in my direction , “ but deep down mace and i are the same . ” * mace and i were running into the same problem at the same time . mathematical wizards that we were we couldn’t solve advanced algebraic equations in our head ; we were vexed by an added integer . we had gotten this far without lifting a pencil . history was being sold to us as a dead language of fixed events and we wouldn’t buy . what is a fact , i wondered , and i could see the same question wrinkling mace’s brow . * mace’s problems weren’t academic . his disgust thrummed like telephone wires in the wind , even his saturnine presence was deceptive , like his beat - up chevy with its secret store of power concealed under the hood . mace too began the year in the front row , placed there on the strength of pure ability . he sank slowly , buoyed as i was , by the one assigned book we read , great expectations . mace attended to his tasks in the classroom . i dreamt of escape via the window’s easy access . there were unknown roads to be driven , gulleys to be plumbed ; girls : a world of lovely distractions . * for all the years i lived in salt lake city i can’t remember seeing a single bird . i felt watched in salt lake city ever since that first day when the old geezer stepped out of the shadows , on a street vast and empty and without verticals , to reprimand my double - mint gum wrapper for lighting in the gutter . but only around the time of hitchcock’s the birds did i start to withdraw from sight . i was keen to see the birds the wednesday afternoon it opened and i wanted the other — “ good ” — “ mark r . , ” the irreproachable blond mormon angel everyone loved , to join us . our growling engine brought his mother to the porch . the sun glared on her helmet of curlers . mark had “ homework and chores , ” she said , he “ can’t come down . ” but he had already descended . and stood framed in the doorway . i couldn’t get accustomed to the light in the trampled meadows around his house , the glow of dandelions , thistles , weeds . mark’s red cheeks reeked of aspiration and i could read his thoughts : why couldn’t i wait until night ? why was i dragging myself down ? why skip history and rifle assembly ? the movie would wait . but i would not . i was keen , and , seeking a purging terror to cleanse me of my dread , i sat alone with mace in the vast empty theater alive to each click and flicker in the projection room , and the radiant impalpable dust caught in the unstinting beam ; released from the limits of our world until the screeching stopped and , looked at askance by strangers , we stepped into an iron dark which held no trace of the light we’d left . * i forked over whatever change i had to fuel each day’s free - wheeling splendor . one morning , knowing mace was down to smoking butts , i brought a pack of my mother’s kents as an offering . mace scorned them . he only smoked marlboros . yet later , desperate and broke in the maze of roads through the hills overlooking the city , he broke off the filters and smoked in silence . i was used to doing the talking for the two of us but this was different . he pulled up besides a long driveway . a vaulted roof jutted above columns of tall firs . this was where he lived . he’d be “ a sec ” — he had “ some smokes ” stashed in a drawer . i followed him past the plaster jockey and the massy trees toward an opulent , utterly contemporary house , fronted by oak door and gold bell - knocker , angular , white , high - ceilinged , skylit … our apartment could have fit into the living room … now i understood : mace lived in the clouds . though i couldn’t see beyond the back yard through the landscaping i knew what the view must be like : that was the reason to live there ; for the nights , when the city , innocent as it was , still blazed through its grid of interlocking lights . * on may day , mace and i , long ago tossed out of r . o . t . c . for “ insubordination , ” but required to attend the final show - of - arms sat together in the bleachers , in splendid isolation , and watched as the rule - followers — led by the many - striped , other mark r . — in their woolen khaki uniforms , shouldering their m 1 rifles , dropped like flies in the insuperable heat .

"i . m . and then the sun came slicing sideways , clear water reflecting it , giving it slant . a gloss of rain so quick and light that day hardly made a sound . the thought of sheets hung out and drying on the line , of seeds in soil and soil itself , the glutting ends of stems of leaves that will them to let fall up and out and through the trees , the shape that shoots could take , of you and this moment as it happens : our echoing hush as we try to hold the close music of the blackbird in the bush . • and then the sun continued on . lough neagh cooled under the firm keels of fishing boats on the water’s taut skin , their painted hulls in pointed arcs an emblem of balance so finely wrought that they could tell the weight of light or air . each night we walk along the shore , expecting still to find your sturdy figure waist - deep in waders , plumbing darkness , hauling it in , but never again your grip on the reel and never again the deft music of the blackbird nesting in your hand .

"i'm 23 . five years ago i graduated . wasted my youth inside even though all i have ever wanted was to be outside and among the warmth of others , but something has always held me back . i have never had a girlfriend , i have never experienced the passion of young love , never had close friends , never had any meaningful human relationships , even though it is all i have ever wanted . i can never keep or maintain the connections i have made , and as the years have slipped further into the past i have let them all drift away . now i am getting older , a slow death march to 30 and beyond , and i am characterised by nothing in particular . i never went to college , missed out on getting an education , missed out on those formative experiences that so many are privileged to have . my friends have moved on , they have gone on to do wonderful things , while i have sat listless and without a sense of direction . i do not drive , an accident years ago has made me deathly afraid of cars . i have no talents , no enthusiasm , no lasting passions or desires or skills or anything . . . i just waste every day that comes to me , shunning every dawn that greets me , turning inward and away from things i know i could be doing , but never seem to . . . failing to reach out towards something , as much as i feel that i must . time is slipping away , and i fear i have wasted too much time already . . . my mind is against me . it is wracked by whatever it is that ails me , add , gad , ocd , fomo , dysthymia , limerence , or some other complex of neuroses . i have tried to work on myself , and for a time i thought things could get better - but my will is fickle . i have lost out on what i could have been . my best years are behind me , and nothing can ever bring them back , nothing can change - so here i am , still stuck , still tethered to myself , hopelessly lonely , lorn of life and love . and all the while , the world is crumbling , the future growing bleaker by the day . the pandemic , the fires and the climate , the strife and violence , corruption and authoritarianism , the suffering and endless struggle . . . nothing gets better . nothing is going to get better . we are the casualties that historians will speak of in the footnotes of the 21st century , of the wars and migrations and ecological catastrophe , the upheaval of everything we know . . . it seems inevitable , and it is no privilege to witness it . maybe it cannot get better . i have asked here before of the wherefore's and why's , but all i have ever gotten were thoughtless words or utter disregard . i doubt anyone cares anyhow , or better yet even has something thoughtful to say , something substantive to prove me otherwise . i desperately wish it were so . maybe i am not worth the effort , i guess . i talk too much anyway , and i cannot seem to capture the visceral , contorted sting in my heart . dispassion is not what i mean to express , but all i feel is numbness . i wish my words were more striking , i wish i could say what i really , really meant . i wish i could tap into the raw vitality of this lived experience , but all i seem to get is this shallowness . but i have lingered long enough , so i will take my leave . i truly hope , from the bottom of my heart , that you all find beauty and ceaseless wonder in this existence , goodness knows it is eluded me .

"d always felt , somehow or other , double . he was an upright line , but then again , he was a curve . when he looked in the mirror straight on , he saw the dapper features of the diplomat he was . but sideways , if he took off his horn - rimmed glasses , he imagined he could be taken for a rather distinguished dame . he always saw both sides to everything . would he ever find his dæmon — the divine spirit within ? did he really have one spirit ? d seemed to be singing a duet with himself . seeing both sides made him a champion procrastinator . d dilly - dallied . waited till the last minute to decide anything . at every posting , he drove the staff crazy . but that was diplomacy . now dusk dropped on the gated embassy grounds . d flipped on his desk lamp , and the pool of light shut out the trees , looming and dissolving . d drew the drapes , deaf to the delicate drone of insect wings . he returned to his desk , trying to distract himself from a strange little pain that had come to him all his life , like a recurrent dream . ( except , he had to confess , he never dreamed . ) the pain was a distinct tiny stab in a spot , well , what would you call that ? d called it down there . for years , since he was a little d , he considered all the options about this strange pain . it was nothing , really . he went long times between feeling it . maybe it was too slight to worry about , but then again . . . at last d decided to see a doctor . as a matter of fact , he saw a number . “ tell me your dreams , ” the first doctor said . “ don't bother to ask me , i never dream , ” d said . “ in dreams begin responsibilities , ” the doctor quoted . d demanded a referral . “ i've got a very specific pain , ” he said to the next doctor . he pointed to , well , down there . “ your testicle , ” the physician said . which required a test . several . and more . finally the second doctor read all the results and announced , “ aha , a dermoid cyst . ” what ? inside the cyst were hair follicles and an eye - type thing with eyelashes and a tooth . “ do you think i was a twin ? ” d wondered with a weird kind of delight as he examined the x - ray . well , the doctor wouldn’t go that far . these dermoid cysts were usually removed in childhood . no reason , however , to remove it now . d wouldn’t dream of having it removed ! it explained everything ! that slightly creepy darling little creature in there must have been a twin , someone d had grown around as she dissolved . d was convinced it was a twin sister . and d had absorbed her . of course he wanted to keep her with him . that very day , he had his first dream . exhausted after his discovery , he had returned to the embassy in the late afternoon . unable to face his office , he diverted his steps from the front walk toward the deserted path on the grounds where no one ever seemed to stroll . he walked deeper into the woods . the path sloped into a shaded dimple in the earth . it was dusk in the dell . d heard the drone of insect wings . in the mottled light a dragonfly dove straight down . up curved a damselfly . impulsively d lay down in the leaves in his three - piece suit and curled up like a praying divine , two hands under his chin . he felt himself melting a little . all the old bedevilments dispersed into a delicate dampness . the world softened from darkling to darling . . . . . . a stately antlered stag appeared in the distance and slowly , with a calm command , walked closer until d could see that he wore a diamond necklace around his neck . the stag slowly bowed his head , doffed his entire rack of antlers , and raised his head up again , looking directly at d . now the deer was a doe ! the doe blinked her eyes at d , as if waking . then she donned the antlers , and turned and walkedaway . . . d woke up ravenously hungry — and overjoyed . he dusted himself off and drove straight to dinner . as he stared out the restaurant window , eating his dumplings , he wondered if responsibilities really do begin in dreams . maybe dreams are responsible to us , he thought . he felt his sister inside him . she was the reason he was a debonair man , a man who understood that everything has two sides : inner / outer , yes / no . d thought both in lines as sharp as the creases in trousers , and in curves like the swirls of a skirt . what do i really know ? he asked himself . only that he had woken strangely endeared to himself — and satisfied . now he understood the necessity of delay . to wait , and then to discover . never to have only one answer . the napkin at the restaurant had come rolled inside a little sparkly ring . “ add this to my bill , ” he said to the waiter . and pocketed the little diadem as a reminder of the dyad he was .

"it all started with a phone call . the customer i was helping asked me if we accepted a specific type of camera to pawn . i said yes but to keep in mind we do have certain requirements , but i couldn’t even get a word into the conversation because he kept cutting me off . he’d keep repeating his question then quickly changed it to another question without giving me a chance to explain . like one of the questions he asked was , what would be the take out amount on his pawn if he were to pick it up within a month . i did some quick math and told him the amount but to keep in mind that interest does increase after two months but if he were to pick it up within two months he would be paying less towards interest and it would be said amount . after the longest time into the phone call , i was finally able to tell him our requirements , and what we needed was all of the items necessary for it to be tested ( the charger , lens , battery and a sd card ) and for us to see that it does work . then queue to him coming in and i’m about to give him the ok but i noticed right away he doesn’t have the power cord to the charger . i told him unfortunately we’re unable to take it in because with every item we take in has to come with a charger and that yes , he did bring in the charger but we needed the power cord to be able to charge the battery , etc . he kept muttering swear words while looking through his bag and found a c - port charger . persisting , he kept telling me that using a c - port charger can be used to charge the camera . i then tell him if i can see it charge while using the c - port charger then we can take it in . to add in , he tells me that i should be knowledgeable in this stuff and that i’m wasting his time . like , to a certain degree , yeah , he’s right , but he , of all people , should know how his camera works instead of taking it out on me and saying i should know how his camera works . because he kept fiddling with his camera not knowing what buttons did what . at this point he’s already irritated and handed me the c port charger to plug it into the outlet . i plug it in but it’s still not showing it’s charging on the camera then he asks me if our outlet is even working . i tell him , yes it works because i’m using the same outlet to charge a phone . then in an annoyed tone , he asks to use it on a different outlet . and this is the part when i should’ve put my foot down but instead i became submissive and complied to him . i ask for the charger and i plug it in but the same issue still happened . then after awhile , i guess he somehow got it to charge and i said alright , we’ll take it in . even though we prefer to have the charger and power cord to the camera . towards the end i tell him we have a $ 3 police ticket fee and that his pawn ticket will read this amount but he’ll be walking out with this amounts minus the three dollars . he , again , gets mad and tells me why in the hell does he have to pay for a fee and that we’re taking his money by doing that . again , i try to explain why but instead he takes out his phone and starts to record me and says “ oh i’m going to love this , what are you going to say , huh ? ” i tell him if he could please put the phone away and that it makes me uncomfortable . one of the main reasons being i have body dysmorphic disorder . at this point i’m choking on my words and on the verge of tears , i look away and continue to do my work and putting the information into the system , and for a minute he proceeds to record me till he finally puts his phone away . so i print out the pawn ticket and i tell him the amount on what it says on the pawn ticket of what it’ll be to take out his item completely . right away he’s furious and yells “ you scammed me , you said it’s going to be this amount over the phone ” and not even once did he allow me to finish the rest of my sentence . he would raise his voice higher , kept talking over me and then ripped the pawn ticket in half and threw it at me . and the money that i handed him earlier , he throws it at me saying “ listen i don’t want your fucking money ” and yells out slurs at me before my coworker comes out and ask if there’s a problem , does he finally go out . at this point i’m crying and to make it worse i couldn’t speak because i was choking on my words . my coworker was trying to console me but i felt ashamed and weak of the situation . if the customer had just been a bit more patient and let me explain that the take out price on the pawn ticket is only that much is if he were to come on the last day to pick it up . and if he were to come within a month , that price would be a lot lower because the interest is lower at the beginning and the interest only increases when it’s been in pawn for a long time . and i don’t know . i’ve been having suicidal thoughts and self harming more . i can’t even hold a basic job without breaking down . i’m not a strong person , i don’t have the confidence , people can easily walk over me . and to make it worse , i’m taking words to heart and i’m becoming bitter and distrustful towards people . i don’t have what it takes and i’m sure others can see that too . tldr : impatient customer gets mad at me . didn’t give me a chance to explain myself and kept talking over me and ultimately i end up crying . i’m having suicidal thoughts again .

pose with books in my hand for hours and hit me when i drop one . she is a very creative woman . : ) i never knew what love was , i only heard this word when she was manic . when she was in her depressed she , knew she was truly honest . she told me she never loved me or will love me and i just exist to try and save her marriage . even tho when i was just a child , i knew this word / idea of it is meaningless . i still believe , it is a lie to make this dark and meaningless barrable . i have learned this lesson , probably way to young . my emotions are almost none existence and if it comes up i have no idea how to handle it . when dog died , 2years ago . i could not cry for him , even tho he was my everything . for a long time he was the only reason for me to keep living . when he died the last bits of emotions i have left died with him . tbh i do not feel like a human anymore . this manifest the most when i see other people show overwhelming emotions like crying . which i have not done since i was 10 . my mother would just punish me harder when i cried and since it was useless to cry , i just kinda stopped it . the only angel in my life was my dad . he is probably the kindest , most moral being you can meet . he rather harm himself than hurt other . sacrifice his own wellbeing , if he could help someone else . my mother always saw him as weak and a pathetic man , because of this . this is why she cheated on him . even tho he knew it , he stayed with her because of me . he does not even know i am his real son , since i look nothing like him . you are asking yourself now why he would not interfere than . she told him if he keep doing it she will kill herself or hurt me even more when he is not around . all he could do is help me once she was done with me . like bring me food when i had to stare a wall , bring me in when it had to sleep outside . he drew the line when i started to hurt myself , like banging my head against things . i did this so she does not have to do it , to make her life a bit easier . in retrospect i probably developed stockholm syndrome . when he wanted to divorce her , the child "" protective "" service wanted to give her the custody . even tho i told them everything , my father encouraged me to do it . so she refused to divorce him if he wanted custody . only accepted , when my father offered her everything he owns and took a huge loan for her . she still got partial custody , cps here is truly a hyper feminist shit show . after a year or so i started to stop visiting her , i was , think 12 , and cps cannot force me to do so . years later she made a tone of money with her cut from the divorce . she is and was a very savy business woman . my father , his new wife and i lived dirt poor . so she started to give me fancy material things , like consoles expensive clothes , etc . . her goal was to separate me from my new family . i am ashamed to say , i fell for i . i was 16 - 17 and stupid . she had a new child and husband , who is more or less just a plaything . she was really good at hiding from me how she treats my half - brothers . but when i realized she has not changed a bit , i gtfo can called cps on here . guess what they told me "" why do not you do something about it yourself "" . . . i have not seen her since . anyway i am pretty sure nobody read through all this but this was my past . i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 1 . 5 years ago and i am still fighting with it . lately it feels like i am losing again , my mood chart is all over the place . since the pandemic and work is getting stressful again and they do not let me do home office anymore , after my country is pretty much back to normal again . i hope the 2nd wave comes soon and i will get the virus ( it's not the lack of trying ) . maybe it can finish the job for me , if i get lucky . my friends think it is joke and do not even realize i am dead serious . even tho i have many friends , since i learned how the brain human works and how the social norms work . i am very fascinated and psychology etc . for me the human brain is like any other machine . i cannot really empathize with humans and use social cues like facial movement and such . i wish i could just have and show real emotions . this what envy most in others . i do not think any of my friends truly like me nor think about me . like bojack horseman said : "" everybody loves me , nobody likes me . "" i know this idea is not true . my brain just will not let me accept it because i do not think i deserve "" love "" . therapy is not really useful for me , i will just start therapy myself . but the meds helped . for a long time i did not believe i would get 20 years old but my dog keeped me alive . i know one day will die of a uncontrollable manic episode or when the void gets to strong and i cannot resist anymore . it is just a question of time . aiming for club 27 right now , guess just a few years to go . there is no such thing as "" love "" in the humanworld just greed , darkness and pain . humans are gruel and selfish , this is why i try my best not to be one . even if my life is worthless others are not . angels like my father are wide and far away . i'm pretty sure if it was not for him teaching me about ethic and morale . i would have became a full on sociopath . i guess he was send from god to save me from this path . not to sound like a edgy teen but with the direction our world is moving right now i do not see hope for humanity . god created this world for us and we treat it like trash . so why even keep being a part of it . nobody will be there following you to the other side to meet your maker . in the end we die all alone . i am sorry this is so long , atleast i am sure no one will have time to read all this . for the few seeing this . you are the first one to see is what i will leave behind , when i am gone . sorry for my bad english , i am not a native speaker .

"hi ! so apparently some girls on reddit , at least one , befriend lonely and sad guys like me and be their gf . i met this girl , lillian , a few months ago on here . we did not talk much but we had some good heart to heart moments . she said she wanted me to he her bf which was the first time it ever happened to someone like me . of course , i was so happy . that night we send sexy videos and pics to each other . now after this we still did not talk much . just some convos here and there . still , i was happy to have a gf . i tried hard in initiating conversations and stuff because i wanted to be a good bf but still , not a lot of talking or much else . just streaks on snap . now i have been depressed since 2012 . i have only tried to kill myself once in 2012 . last week was a pretty rough week for me . the "" friends "" i have made this year started blocking me and deleting me . i do not have irl friends . i tried reaching out to my gf for support but she did not text back much and i was not sure if i should talk to her about it . so i tried to od on sleeping pills . did not work because apparently it is hard to do . at this point i only had 3 friends . i reached out to all three and they helped me stop self harm . today i got a text from my gf . i was surprised because she never texted me first . she said she was breaking up with me . apparently she only told me that she wanted me as her bf because she wanted to bully someone online . she made fun of me , my body , and my personality . while i was processing this and trying to talk to her , she tells me that she was currently showing her friends our chat log . her friends thinks i am a loser , of course i am . i fell for that . i should have known no one would ever wanna be with me . when i told her that i was suicidal she did a whole 180 and offered to send me nudes if it would "" make me happy "" . she sent the nudes and it did not help one bit . so now , i am in my room , a lot of benadryl in my nightstand and a pair of scissors in my closet . i probably will end it all since my 3 friends are busy tonight and i have reached out and they have not opened my texts . thank you for reading , good - bye . tldr : bully pretends to be my gf , unbeknownst to me , and after a month tells me how it was all a lie and now i am going to end it all tonight . sorry if i did not tell the story well i do not want to post her user here but a part of me wants the internet to bully her too . sadly , i care about her and i would not want her to get hurt .

"i could not find a good way to describe it in the title but the stigma surrounding mental health is very prevalent in my community . i live in a predominatly asian community that is also in a pretty low - income area . i come from a family of asian immigrants but i was born on american soil and have been here my whole life . nobody in my family believes in the existence of mental illness except my cousins and nieces / nephews who were born here and have received an american education . if i cannot find support from my family , i can go to a doctor or something to ask for help right ? not really because i have witnessed how judgemental some doctors and nurses in my area are of ppl with mental health issues . there is a local clinic i have been to my entire life for occasional health issues . ive been treated poorly by the nurses there because of my stutter and have been made fun of for most of my life . if you go on google reviews , you will see that the clinic has a 2 / 5 star rating and all of the complaints mention the blatant racism and discrimination from the staff . there was a homeless man roaming around the area one day and had very obvious mental health issues . instead of empathizing with him , the doctors and nurses looked at him with disgust and made comments and assumptions about his life choices while calling him "" insane "" and "" crazy . "" and not just in the medical community , but also in law enforcement and ems ive heard of officers and emts mistreating people with mental illnesses . when the topic of suicide came up , my hs emt teacher was very clear on his stance with suicide . he told us it was stupid and selfish for people to kill themselves and how it would just pass the pain onto another person . i mean i do somewhat agree with it but he never really acknowledged the feelings of the people being suicidal , which left a bad taste in my mouth for about a year now when i think about what he said . maybe the clinic and the staff are just a bunch of bad apples and there are more supportive medical professionals / law enforcement / emt in my area , but seeing that these people exist in a place that is supposed to support and help you is fucking scary . i am sure a lot of these people were taught to suppress their emotions like i had been taught at a young age . i am kinda glad that my school had taught me the opposite of that and a lot of people are continuing to raise awareness for mental health , but there are still a lot of old and traditional people in power who do not really believe in our struggles .

"this is gonna sound stupid but like the title says , i am constantly falling back and fourth between wanting to kill myself and not after i have gained a schedule but as soon as i do not have a schedule i feel sick . i started a new job 2 weeks ago and i have been feeling fine , a few moments here and again of wanting to die but otherwise i was feeling good but after today i just had the disgusting realization i have to do this for another 9 months at least . i do not have any other options . it is not even a bad job it is just . . . repetitive . by the end of the day i am vying to walk out the door and not walk back in and i am already at that point of hate for it . i just . why ? ? is this normal ? ? am i the only one that wants to kms as soon as something gets to be consistent ? ? like my actual wanted career is not like this but it will be another 4 years waiting on that . i cannot leave and get up and go , still under lock and key at my parents house so it just feels like finally giving in and killing myself would be peaceful . please tell me i am not the only one .

my suicidal thoughts have been getting so much worse lately and today i could not take it and tried to jump off my balcony . my boyfriend saw me and grabbed me and held me there for the 30 minutes it took my mom to get to my house for them to be able to safely pull me over the edge . 10 minutes later when they were not looking i tried to run to jump again but my mother grabbed me by my legs to stop me . now they are watching me very closely and brought me ice cream . i feel so guilty for making them cry but at the same time i want to do it again and do not know how to control my thoughts . . . ,1,,,2967

"hey . what is up . guess i am here now . look , i have always had periodic run - ins with mr . depresso . i guess i just have the right genes for it . and right now i am not in my longest - ever episode , there is no rational reason for me to believe that this is going to turn out differently than the past times ( except once when i actually made an attempt - - or , well , to be more precise , i was going for an attempt and then broke it off at the last minute ) , but hey , it always feels like the worst time , every time . i do not think i have posted here till now . i know my fiancée used to , when she was feeling like this . well , ex - fiancée . short story is , i was too broke to live with her , i am a high school dropout so no job prospects , and she is american and i am just not , so i could not stay in the country with her . we could not entertain a long - distance relationship in the end , so now it is over till either of us ever makes it to where the other is . so she is gone , that is great . now fast forward please , because that is already months behind me . i somehow managed to pull off a fucking magic trick and make it into university . well , i made it into a foundation year program , which is actually a foundation - year - and - a - half because the only way they would admit me is by tacking on an extra semester , but jeez , i am impressed at that outcome nonetheless . only problem ; i need to move for uni , and non ho niente denaro . neither does my family . support from them is expected to be zero . in fact , my sister is livid at the thought of me quitting and not going there , because if i left she would have to pay a bigger share of the rent . and that is how she thinks about me . and well , i have time till new year's to come up with something or kill myself . i have weighed the options , guys . there is no mathematical chance in hell short of a miracle that i will be able to make it there . tuition was already a nightmare , i only managed to pay that with my mom's help , but we both know that the savings she took out then were the last scraps she had . and she still keeps trying to reassure me , keeps telling me , "" if you do not make it on your own , i will just loan you the money , whatever you need ! "" bullshit . she has none . we both know that . and here is the thing , fellas . university is the key . university is the only shot i have . i am enrolling in pisa ( the one with the tower , yes ) , for a degree that pretty much only exists there , at least in continental europe . it is the only thing that came up at the very end of my "" what the hell shall i do with myself "" quest . if it is not this , it is nothing . i cannot keep living with the fam , either . they are moving out soon , to a new country ( we have family dispersed all over the globe , you see ) , and i am not exactly expected to be part of that relocation package . because on the one hand they do not want me to go to uni , but then again they require me to . whatever is most convenient to them . if anyone wants an explanation as to why we are so piss - poor , well , apart from my resumé which i already linked above ( high school dropout , no us work authorization , i think that is it ) , my mom is an interior designer who does not know how to work computers well ( i . e . she is working minimum - wage jobs unrelated to her degree now ) , my sister actually makes a decent living but she is going to a private art school so her tuition takes the lion's share , and my dad is retired , sitting on a pension that we all know is capital - p phat because he used to earn six figures as a hotel manager , but he is not sharing it with any of us ( parents are separated , just not quite divorced yet yadda yadda ) . my only ever source of income have been various online gig - type things , you know , the kinds of jobs where they tell you you are not legally an employee but an "" independent freelance remote subcontractor "" or some bullshit like that . & # x200b ; tl , dr ; i wanna kill myself .

"i’ve been experiencing depression on and off since i was around 14 . but for the last couple of years , its been a constant weight on my shoulders . i used to cry every night and look up different ways of killing myself but my hope ( delusion actually ) for a brighter future always prevented me from doing it . my parents / home situation has contributed a lot to my depression . i come from a strict muslim family who have pressured me since i was a little child to get straight as and be this perfect little girl that they can show off to their friends . they have been mentally abusive to me ( and used to be physically abusive , but that stopped when i was about 13 ) my whole life telling me that if i don’t succeed i’ll be worthless and a whore . they tell me constantly that i make them want to die and that they’re going to send me back to their home country ( in the middle east ) . they don’t let me have friends or leave the house , they get mad when i listen to music or watch a movie , they give me money but then constantly ask me what i have left , what i’ve spent it on , etc . i’m not even explaining this properly , there is so much more messed up shit they’ve said and done to me but its hard to remember on spot . i’ve tried to tell my parents several times that i experience severe depression / anxiety and have adhd , but they refuse to believe in mental illness and won’t let me get the help i need . i feel so useless and dumb . since i was a kid , they’ve wanted me to become a doctor or some kind of engineer , so you can imagine how they reacted when i told them i wanted to do something arts - related . that situation in particular got so out of hand that i ended up in the hospital because of severe heart palpitations and my dad didn’t even believe me . they forced me to major in something i have no passion for , and my marks were pretty bad , although i didn’t tell them . they just found out and on top of that , i finally told them that i’m taking a gap year from university so i can work full - time and pay off some of my debts . my dad threatened me and both my parents went on a tirade of how disgusting i am ( this is a weekly occurrence btw ) . the situation has calmed down a bit , but my dad keeps guilting me , my mom locked herself in her room and is balling her eyes out , and they’re threatening to kick me out . if they kick me out i have nowhere to go and no money saved up . on top of all this , i’ve lost 2 jobs this year and all of my friends . i feel so alone . i’m seriously deciding whether i should jump off a cliff ( almost 300ft ) or take an entire bottle of my mother’s sleeping pills .

"i recently graduated high school and am taking online university classes . i only enrolled in university because of pressure from my parents and because i didn’t know what else to do . i hate classes , i hate studying , i hate exams . i am so done with the education system . i hate university and already feel like i want to quit . if i did , however , i wouldn’t have anything else to do . i have no valuable skills , and you can’t get a well - paying job without further education or skills that people want . as a result , i feel like i have no real life to enjoy ahead of me . i have to go to school , be a deadbeat living with my parents my whole life , or live near the poverty line . i feel so directionless . i don’t know what to do . it is all so hopeless and i don’t understand how anyone gets through this phase of uncertainty after high school . it is awful , so awful in fact that i have to wonder why people even have children if they know they’ll have to go through it . while i’m not sure if i would ever actually commit suicide , i fantasize about it very frequently , and since i live in a home that has a locker full of guns in it , it would be incredibly easy to do . how on earth did any of you get past the “ 18 and clueless ” phase ?

"2 there is no end to the torment that comes from watching dead actors in old , and no so old , movies , and you always fall into the hole of uncertainty ; you know you don’t know if they’re alive or dead , some of them look so radiant on films made not so long ago . richard harris , the hero of the heroes of telemark , is undergoing a second birth in old man roles , while in the rockface rappelling , snow on castles icecapade , where eagles dare , two out of three leads , richard burton and mary ure , are both quite dead , as is her second husband , robert shaw . a lot happens in eagles , but what sticks in my mind is the escape , where mary ure , coifed , oblique glimmer of a smile , cradling a machine gun like a weightless toy on the caboose’s deck , bullets in mesmerizingly endless supply , decorously mows down row on row of nazi pursuers , who drop into the white alpine ridges like knocked over counters in a game , as if she were answering the blasts from jimmy porter’s trumpet as they merge with a shrieking train whistle and screech of brakes . 3 to st paul’s church , covent garden , for robert shaw’s memorial service . a beautiful , still day . there was a gathering of figures from the profession , plus friends and family . harold pinter gave a short address , stressing bob the writer . . . it was a fairly joyful occasion , serious but not sad . i had my usual bewilderment about our lack of ritual . we all huddled together in the sunshine outside the church — paul scofield , kenneth haigh , harold , and many , many others . we all wanted to be together in bob's memory . but what could we , un - christian as most of us are , do ? off to the riverside studios to see the changeling , beautifully staged by peter gill , precise and clear . but i had the impression of a not very talented cast dutifully following the conception of a quite brilliant director . — 1978 , saturday 7 october , peter hall’s diaries i abhor assumptions but from the tension robert shaw emitted on screen and in his other incarnations , the athletic boozer’s fatal heart attack in middle - age seemed at first less surprising than mary’s ure’s ambiguous end . shaw looks so painfully alive in jaws as the shark - crazed minor ahab it’s hard to digest how quickly he raced toward a death from natural causes , so shortly afterwards . there’s much that could be said about robert shaw , a ubiquitous , menacing , explosive presence during the previous decade in british films before the american public began to pin a name",0,,,640

"i remember when i wrote the circus i was living in paris , or rather we were living in paris janice , frank was alive , the whitney museum was still on 8th street , or was it still something else ? fernand léger lived in our building well it wasn’t really our building it was the building we lived in next to a grand guignol troupe who made a lot of noise so that one day i yelled through a hole in the wall of our apartment i don’t know why there was a hole there shut up ! and the voice came back to me saying something i don’t know what . once i saw léger walk out of the building i think . stanley kunitz came to dinner . i wrote the circus in two tries , the first getting most of the first stanza ; that fall i also wrote an opera libretto called louisa or matilda . jean - claude came to dinner . he said ( about “ cocktail sauce ” ) it should be good on something but not on these ( oysters ) . by that time i think i had already written the circus when i came back , having been annoyed to have to go i forget what i went there about you were back in the apartment what a dump actually we liked it i think with your hair and your writing and the pans moving strummingly about the kitchen and i wrote the circus it was a summer night no it was an autumn one summer when i remember it but actually no autumn that black dusk toward the post office and i wrote many other poems then but the circus was the best maybe not by far the best geography was also wonderful and the airplane betty poems ( inspired by you ) but the circus was the best . sometimes i feel i actually am the person who did this , who wrote that , including that poem the circus but sometimes on the other hand i don’t . there are so many factors engaging our attention ! at every moment the happiness of others , the health of those we know and our own ! and the millions upon millions of people we don’t know and their well - being to think about so it seems strange i found time to write the circus and even spent two evenings on it , and that i have also the time to remember that i did it , and remember you and me then , and write this poem about it at the beginning of the circus the circus girls are rushing through the night in the circus wagons and tulips and other flowers will be picked a long time from now this poem wants to get off on its own someplace like a painting not held to a depiction of composing the circus . noel lee was in paris then but usually out of it in germany or denmark giving a concert as part of an endless activity which was either his career or his happiness or a combination of both or neither i remember his dark eyes looking he was nervous with me perhaps because of our days at harvard . it is understandable enough to be nervous with anybody ! how softly and easily one feels when alone love of one’s friends when one is commanding the time and space syndrome if that’s the right word which i doubt but together how come one is so nervous ? one is not always but what was i then and what am i now attempting to create if create is the right word out of this combination of experience and aloneness and who are you telling me it is or is not a poem ( not you ? ) go back with me though to those nights i was writing the circus . do you like that poem ? have you read it ? it is in my book thank you which grove just reprinted . i wonder how long i am going to live and what the rest will be like i mean the rest of my life . john cage said to me the other night how old are you ? and i told him forty - six ( since then i’ve become forty - seven ) he said oh that’s a great age i remember . john cage once told me he didn’t charge much for his mushroom identification course ( at the new school ) because he didn’t want to make a profit from nature he was ahead of his time i was behind my time we were both in time brilliant go to the head of the class and “ time is a river ” it doesn’t seem like a river to me it seems like an unformed plan days go by and still nothing is decided about what to do until you know it never will be and then you say “ time ” but you really don’t care much about it any more time means something when you have the major part of yours ahead of you as i did in aix - en - provence that was three years before i wrote the circus that year i wrote bricks and the great atlantic rainway i felt time surround me like a blanket endless and soft i could go to sleep endlessly and wake up and still be in it but i treasured secretly the part of me that was individually changing like noel lee i was interested in my career and still am but now it is like a town i don’t want to leave not a tower i am climbing opposed by ferocious enemies i never mentioned my friends in my poems at the time i wrote the circus although they meant almost more than anything to me of this now for some time i’ve felt an attenuation so i’m mentioning them maybe this will bring them back to me not them perhaps but what i felt about them john ashbery jane freilicher larry rivers frank o’hara their names alone bring tears to my eyes as seeing polly did last night it is beautiful at any time but the paradox is leaving it in order to feel it when you’ve come back the sun has declined and the people are merrier or else they’ve gone home altogether and you are left alone well you put up with that your sureness is like the sun while you have it but when you don’t its lack’s a black and icy night . i came home and wrote the circus that night , janice . i didn’t come and speak to you and put my arm around you and ask you if you’d like to take a walk or go to the cirque medrano though that’s what i wrote poems about and am writing about that now , and now i’m alone and this is not as good a poem as the circus and i wonder if any good will come of either of them all the same .

"i just wanted to write a short story about what happened 6 years ago when i attempted suicide on ssri’s . i was prescribed with 100mg of zoloft or sertraline once daily . when night after working and smoking weed , i came home and while my parents were asleep i decided i didn’t wanna live anymore because i was constantly being emotionally abused and felt like shit constantly . i had tried twice previously to overdose and both were minuscule amounts compared to what i was gonna try . i emptied what was left of a bottle , about 2500mg , and downed all in one gulp . . 15 minutes went by and i had mild stomach pain but i became extremely tired and soon i past out in my bedroom . what happened next has changed me completely to this today . i remember this big figure in my vision and then i woke up vomiting all over my floor . my mom ran down and asked if i was okay and i said i was and that i must’ve ate something wrong . she went up stairs and i went back to sleep . i then woke up in the morning , roughly 8 hours after overdosing and i thought i was dead . i saw writing everywhere . on my arms , on the walls , on the ceilings . they were all notes from everyone i knew saying they were sorry i had committed suicide and that they wish i was still there . everyone ended with love and their name . i immediately got up , my mom was doing laundry and i asked her if i was dead and if she could see me . she knew immediately something was wrong and my grandma who lived next door came up and sat down with me and i admitted to overdosing . i saw her bawling next to me as i began to cry too , still seeing these writings on everything . we went to the hospital , as i waited to be checked in i continued to see these writings , from friends , family , and loved ones . shortly i went back , they attempted to pump my stomach , however due to me vomiting earlier i had nothing to get pumped out . they asked if i wanted to admit myself to the psychiatric hospital or they were going to force me to go and i said i will go . during my time at the hospital i continued to see these visions . eventually the notes that i saw from friends and family stopped showing and instead it appeared as though someone was communicating with me . he said he was from the future . he was me and the world was a disaster . half of the world was flooded and we were doing terrible . to this day i still see words appear if i focus , however i often forget and do not focus on anything long enough for it to appear . i now know i had to have experienced seratonin syndrome to a certain degree . the experience changed me . it began the change that allowed me to go from major depressed to having no depression at all after years of rewiring my brain . i do not advocate anyone commit suicide . and the experience i had was awful . what i got out of it was that there are so many people who love you and it is not worth taking your life . i know we all feel low and sometimes lower than we should , but we all are here for a reason . remember : everybody love everybody . i hope this helps someone who is thinking about suicide to not go through with it . i love you all , and the universe loves you as well .

"i'm 15 and i have been becoming progressively more suicidally depressed in the recent month . there are a lot of reasons why . the first of which being i am not a good person to be friends with . there is something in my brain that prevents me from being a good friend to people . i am not mean or abusive , i am the opposite . i get too attached to my friends and i am too obnoxious and annoying to the point where i have had friends make discord voice channels that they think i cannot see ( i have js mod that lets me see hidden text and voice channels ) just to avoid playing games with me . whenever i find myself sharing something i did that i am at least somewhat proud of i see them getting either belittled or ignored . now this is not my friend's fault , my overbearing and annoying personality makes them by default look down upon me . i am not autistic or have any other behavioral disorders , i am just annoying and i do not know of any friends that like my personality . most just seemingly tolerate me out of what seems like pity . i had one friend who i had a deep connection with who had a personality equally as annoying and overbearing and we got along great to the point of almost attraction , but we were at a school that i hated and i forced her out of my life when i made the decision to go to the school that the friends i have been talking about attended . i rarely talk to her now , solely over twitter and discord . the fact that i am aware of this resentment from my friends and isolation from the one person i truly connected with has given me a really , really bad , overhanging sense of loneliness . & # x200b ; the second reason is that i am not good at anything that i want to do . as a 15 year old , the most important things in my life are schoolwork and video games . lets start with the latter as its easier to unpack and far less important in the grand scheme of things . despite me trying my absolute hardest and have been playing games actively for almost three years now , i am still stuck at a level that borders from "" occasionally good "" to "" complete retardedness "" . i will give team fortress 2 as an example . i have been playing the game since march 2018 and have ranked nearly 700 hours in it with 10 hours on my least played class and over 50 on my most played . despite these hours that would usually signify at the very least a competent player , i still do not really preform all that well in games and maybe average middle of the pack . in overwatch , i am nearly always just deadweight . i never really do anything that even stands out . my competitive rankings are abysmally low ( highest is 1319sr , lowest is 1250 which is considered mid to low bronze ) . i have put almost 70 hours into the game and am level 55 currently . compare this to my friend who started playing overwatch in july of this year ( about 6 or so months after me ) who immediately placed in diamond in competitive in his first competitive season and is now higher level than me . they claim its because he watched overwatch youtube videos or because he is been playing fps games longer but its really just because they did not want to say to my face that i am a retard . and then comes schoolwork where i am average at best . i cannot do math for shit , my writing is sometimes okay , i am good at social studies but that is not hard to achieve considering its literally just memorization and writing , and the technical side of science just does not correlate to my brain . then comes the other stuff i do like music . i claim to be able to play a lot of instruments , but in reality i am barely competent at any of them , even the ones i play in school band . & # x200b ; the third and final reason is that i have literally no reason to kill myself . i sound like real privileged kid to give these as real reasons why i am intensely depressed , and to be fair , i am . i am a white , upper - middle class cisgendered male and although i admit i am not straight , i live in a family and country where it literally will not effect me negatively . juxtaposed to my friends where one of my friends is a drug addict , one has a father in really poor health who could die at any time without warning and almost has twice , and one with really strict and abusive parents . juxtaposed to people all over the world who get killed because of their skin color , gender , sexuality or for being trans . juxtaposed to the people on this subreddit who can barely afford food , have no friends , a family that does not give a shit about them or are abusive to them . i have no reason to complain . i have a roof over my head , i eat everyday , i never have to worry about my water getting me sick . i do not have parents that hate me or disowned me . i do not have to worry about loved ones dying . so why do i yearn for a future that i am not in ? & # x200b ; tl ; dr : i am a perpetually mediocre kid whose natural personality drives people away dealing with crippeling self hatred and loneliness . i have no chance at succeeding in life once i leave the luxury of my privileged life and i am deeply depressed because of it . & # x200b ; if anyone by some chance reads this , i apologize for having made you read this , but i also appreciate it because i do not feel anyone else would .

"after kees' "" travels in north america "" 1 . santa fe "" the walls are old , "" he says . i turn in the plaza and nod to weldon kees , his face as dark as the cool shadows that surround us , walls keeping him safe , honoring his silence , though he comes to me to be led away . "" the mountains out there are not old , "" he claims and slips his hands into his coat . we cross the street , each indian blanket on the ground holding jewelry i would love to touch , but kees and the navajo man selling his crafts are whispering to the ground . kees surprises me by entering the museum of arts . i follow him , the stone floor ringing with our footsteps , empty arches blending above . kees stops and turns to me . "" one can see only so much , "" he says . he leads me to the twisted dwarf , the tangles form of faith and death , arrows bristling from its muscled body , a sacrifice of the ugly encased in glass , kees staring at the sculpture as if he knows why we really cannot see it . he points to the deepest arrow and places a hand on my shoulder . "" when you believe this , you are home , "" he tells me and walks out . 2 . albuquerque the sangre de cristo mountains are old and he is driving my car to the highest ridge , the valley below avoiding the bright moon , the same white light in the bay kees wanted to touch before he left . "" mist and clouds are a lie , "" he claims . "" look down there . men are running away . "" he drives slowly to the top and we get out , the autumn sun burning terraces into scrub cedars and piñon pines he wrote about when he crossed here long ago , standing on the edge of the cliff as if this is the only way for him to go . "" look past what you want to see , "" he sighs as the wind takes his slick hair and makes him into someone i have seen before , the streets of albuquerque down there as dusty as his closed eyes . we stand on the edge and i wait at this elevation with kees who wrote that the towns we will not visit are places where home truly lies . "" i must go , "" he decides . "" where to ? "" i ask . "" anyplace you have not seen , "" he says , and walks down the mountain . 3 . tyuonyi kees and i are happy when the sun splits the tree for a moment because yesterday controlled this mountain dawn , burning mud deeper into the adobe . cottonwoods catch fire here , give the people time to hide inside turtle shells , though they come out to watch us . i stop as the drawings come to life under the arches , symbols familiar to those who sleep by crossing the street each night . as i stare , i realize a man who diappears wants to understand and not hide , yet the designs tempt me to walk in the wrong direction and leave him behind . to go farther up would mean a canyon where i have been . a dirt street inside another path , tiny houses falling back , letting me pass beyond their locked doors , as if the smoking windows know where i must go . when i enter the placita , the old woman is not there because this is about bringing kees back . the dirt street opens to the last scorched tree breaking out of walls to shade what cannot be blessed , its branches confusing until their cracks enter the ground in search of peace . 4 . santa maria water disappears to settle as clear glass that contains memories of thirst , the ancient hole found in the ruins , kees' hand keeping the others from skimming the surface of the still water , reaching to be alone under the mountain wall , though eyes that watch have seen this before , men entering and never coming out . one hand keeps the other from touching the surface . pulling back allows the echo of falling rocks , the deep swimmer breaking through walls to emerge on the other side of the well where the first figures to emerge in centuries are sitting and rubbing sand over their wet , shivering bodies . 5 . fort selden kees is getting tired in the desert heat and sits on a historic slab of western settlement , this old fort a museum where thirsty men come to drink from the bitter well . kees smokes too many cigarettes and shakes his head at me , "" look at the moth and the deep iris in your garden because the equation i found in san francisco is an eclipse drawn on paper by my trembling hands .

"" i stare at him and he tosses smoke on the ground because we are close to home . 6 . el paso kees waits at the bus station in my hometown . we cannot go farther because the border here is out there and as violent as the reasons he disappeared in san francisco a long time ago . i want to tell him who i think he is , but i grew up here and must hide how things have really been , drawing the light off the mountains as if the doubters of history are simply starving boys offering to shine kees' shoes on the corner of paisano street . my hometown has a bridge , but kees will not go near it because he says to cross it would be to admit there is something wrong on the other side of my family's house . he can never cross because we have found our way here , el paso dreaming its population of mute men must keep growing because the border keeps taking too many of them away . kees looks at the bus schedule , runs out of cigarettes and everything is closed . he nods at nothing and waits on the bench with someone he swears looks like me .

" [ introduction ] lo now ! four other acts upon the stage , childhood , and youth , the manly , and old - age . the first : son unto phlegm , grand - child to water , unstable , supple , moist , and cold’s his nature . the second : frolic claims his pedigree ; from blood and air , for hot and moist is he . the third of fire and choler is compos’d , vindicative , and quarrelsome dispos’d . the last , of earth and heavy melancholy , solid , hating all lightness , and all folly . childhood was cloth’d in white , and given to show , his spring was intermixed with some snow . upon his head a garland nature set : of daisy , primrose , and the violet . such cold mean flowers ( as these ) blossom betime , before the sun hath throughly warm’d the clime . his hobby striding , did not ride , but run , and in his hand an hour - glass new begun , in dangers every moment of a fall , and when ‘tis broke , then ends his life and all . but if he held till it have run its last , then may he live till threescore years or past . next , youth came up in gorgeous attire ( as that fond age , doth most of all desire ) , his suit of crimson , and his scarf of green . in’s countenance , his pride quickly was seen . garland of roses , pinks , and gillyflowers seemed to grow on’s head ( bedew’d with showers ) . his face as fresh , as is aurora fair , when blushing first , she ‘gins to red the air . no wooden horse , but one of metal try’d : he seems to fly , or swim , and not to ride . then prancing on the stage , about he wheels ; but as he went , death waited at his heels . the next came up , in a more graver sort , as one that cared for a good report . his sword by’s side , and choler in his eyes , but neither us’d ( as yet ) for he was wise , of autumn fruits a basket on his arm , his golden rod in’s purse , which was his charm . and last of all , to act upon this stage , leaning upon his staff , comes up old age . under his arm a sheaf of wheat he bore , a harvest of the best : what needs he more ? in’s other hand a glass , ev’n almost run , this writ about : this out , then i am done . his hoary hairs and grave aspect made way , and all gave ear to what he had to say . these being met , each in his equipage intend to speak , according to their age , but wise old - age did with all gravity to childish childhood give precedency , and to the rest , his reason mildly told : that he was young , before he grew so old . to do as he , the rest full soon assents , their method was that of the elements , that each should tell what of himself he knew , both good and bad , but yet no more then’s true . with heed now stood , three ages of frail man , to hear the child , who crying , thus began . childhood ah me ! conceiv’d in sin , and born in sorrow , a nothing , here to day , but gone to morrow , whose mean beginning , blushing can’t reveal , but night and darkness must with shame conceal . my mother’s breeding sickness , i will spare , her nine months’ weary burden not declare . to shew her bearing pangs , i should do wrong , to tell that pain , which can’t be told by tongue . with tears into this world i did arrive ; my mother still did waste , as i did thrive , who yet with love and all alacity , spending was willing to be spent for me . with wayward cries , i did disturb her rest , who sought still to appease me with her breast ; with weary arms , she danc’d , and by , by , sung , when wretched i ( ungrate ) had done the wrong . when infancy was past , my childishness did act all folly that it could express . my silliness did only take delight , in that which riper age did scorn and slight , in rattles , bables , and such toyish stuff . my then ambitious thoughts were low enough . my high - born soul so straitly was confin’d that its own worth it did not know nor mind . this little house of flesh did spacious count , through ignorance , all troubles did surmount , yet this advantage had mine ignorance , freedom from envy and from arrogance . how to be rich , or great , i did not cark , a baron or a duke ne’r made my mark , nor studious was , kings favours how to buy , with costly presents , or base flattery ; no office coveted , wherein i might make strong my self and turn aside weak right . no malice bare to this or that great peer , nor unto buzzing whisperers gave ear . i gave no hand , nor vote , for death , of life . i’d nought to do , ‘twixt prince , and peoples’ strife . no statist i : nor marti’list i’ th’ field . where e’re i went , mine innocence was shield . my quarrels , not for diadems , did rise , but for an apple , plumb , or some such prize . my strokes did cause no death , nor wounds , nor scars . my little wrath did cease soon as my wars . my duel was no challenge , nor did seek . my foe should weltering , with his bowels reek . i had no suits at law , neighbours to vex , nor evidence for land did me perplex . i fear’d no storms , nor all the winds that blows . i had no ships at sea , no fraughts to loose . i fear’d no drought , nor wet ; i had no crop , nor yet on future things did place my hope . this was mine innocence , but oh the seeds lay raked up of all the cursed weeds , which sprouted forth in my insuing age , as he can tell , that next comes on the stage . but yet me let me relate , before i go , the sins and dangers i am subject to : from birth stained , with adam’s sinful fact , from thence i ‘gan to sin , as soon as act ; a perverse will , a love to what’s forbid ; a serpent’s sting in pleasing face lay hid ; a lying tongue as soon as it could speak and fifth commandment do daily break ; oft stubborn , peevish , sullen , pout , and cry ; then nought can please , and yet i know not why . as many was my sins , so dangers too , for sin brings sorrow , sickness , death , and woe , and though i miss the tossings of the mind , yet griefs in my frail flesh i still do find . what gripes of wind , mine infancy did pain ? what tortures i , in breeding teeth sustain ? what crudities my cold stomach hath bred ? whence vomits , worms , and flux have issued ? what breaches , knocks , and falls i daily have ? and some perhaps , i carry to my grave . sometimes in fire , sometimes in water fall : strangely preserv’d , yet mind it not at all . at home , abroad , my danger’s manifold that wonder ‘tis , my glass till now doth hold . i’ve done : unto my elders i give way , for ‘tis but little that a child can say . youth my goodly clothing and beauteous skin declare some greater riches are within , but what is best i‘ll first present to view , and then the worst , in a more ugly hue , for thus to do we on this stage assemble , then let not him , which hath most craft dissemble . mine education , and my learning‘s such , as might my self , and others , profit much : with nurture trained up in virtue‘s schools ; of science , arts , and tongues , i know the rules ; the manners of the court , i likewise know , nor ignorant what they in country do . the brave attempts of valiant knights i prize that dare climb battlements , rear‘d to the skies . the snorting horse , the trumpet , drum i like , the glist‘ring sword , and well advanced pike . i cannot lie in trench before a town , nor wait til good advice our hopes do crown . i scorn the heavy corslet , musket - proof ; i fly to catch the bullet that‘s aloof . though thus in field , at home , to all most kind , so affable that i do suit each mind , i can insinuate into the breast and by my mirth can raise the heart deprest . sweet music rapteth my harmonious soul , and elevates my thoughts above the pole . my wit , my bounty , and my courtesy makes all to place their future hopes on me . this is my best , but youth ( is known ) alas , to be as wild as is the snuffing ass , as vain as froth , as vanity can be , that who would see vain man may look on me : my gifts abus‘d , my education lost , my woful parents‘ longing hopes all crost ; my wit evaporates in merriment ; my valour in some beastly quarrel‘s spent ; martial deeds i love not , ‘cause they’re virtuous , but doing so , might seem magnanimous . my lust doth hurry me to all that’s ill , i know no law , nor reason , but my will ; sometimes lay wait to take a wealthy purse or stab the man in’s own defence , that’s worse . sometimes i cheat ( unkind ) a female heir of all at once , who not so wise , as fair , trusteth my loving looks and glozing tongue until her friends , treasure , and honour’s gone . sometimes i sit carousing others’ health until mine own be gone , my wit , and wealth . from pipe to pot , from pot to words and blows , for he that loveth wine wanteth no woes . days , nights , with ruffins , roarers , fiddlers spend , to all obscenity my ears i bend , all counsel hate which tends to make me wise , and dearest friends count for mine enemies . if any care i take , ‘tis to be fine , for sure my suit more than my virtues shine . if any time from company i spare , ‘tis spent in curling , frisling up my hair , some young adonais i do strive to be . sardana pallas now survives in me . cards , dice , and oaths , concomitant , i love ; to masques , to plays , to taverns still i move ; and in a word , if what i am you’d hear , seek out a british , bruitish cavalier . such wretch , such monster am i ; but yet more i want a heart all this for to deplore . thus , thus alas ! i have mispent my time , my youth , my best , my strength , my bud , and prime , remembring not the dreadful day of doom , nor yet the heavy reckoning for to come , though dangers do attend me every hour and ghastly death oft threats me with her power : sometimes by wounds in idle combats taken , sometimes by agues all my body shaken ; sometimes by fevers , all my moisture drinking , my heart lies frying , and my eyes are sinking . sometimes the cough , stitch , painful pleurisy , with sad affrights of death , do menace me . sometimes the loathsome pox my face be - mars with ugly marks of his eternal scars . sometimes the frenzy strangely mads my brain that oft for it in bedlam i remain . too many’s my diseases to recite , that wonder ‘tis i yet behold the light , that yet my bed in darkness is not made , and i in black oblivion’s den long laid . of marrow full my bones , of milk my breasts , ceas’d by the gripes of serjeant death's arrests : thus i have said , and what i’ve said you see , childhood and youth is vain , yea vanity . middle age childhood and youth forgot , sometimes i’ve seen , and now am grown more staid that have been green , what they have done , the same was done by me : as was their praise , or shame , so mine must be . now age is more , more good ye do expect ; but more my age , the more is my defect . but what’s of worth , your eyes shall first behold , and then a world of dross among my gold . when my wild oats were sown , and ripe , and mown , i then receiv’d a harvest of mine own . my reason , then bad judge , how little hope such empty seed should yield a better crop . i then with both hands graspt the world together , thus out of one extreme into another , but yet laid hold on virtue seemingly : who climbs without hold , climbs dangerously . be my condition mean , i then take pains my family to keep , but not for gains . if rich , i’m urged then to gather more to bear me out i’ th’ world and feed the poor ; if a father , then for children must provide , but if none , then for kindred near ally’d ; if noble , then mine honour to maintain ; if not , yet wealth , nobility can gain . for time , for place , likewise for each relation , i wanted not my ready allegation . yet all my powers for self - ends are not spent , for hundreds bless me for my bounty sent , whose loins i’ve cloth’d , and bellies i have fed , with mine own fleece , and with my household bread . yea , justice i have done , was i in place , to cheer the good and wicked to deface . the proud i crush’d , th’oppressed i set free , the liars curb’d but nourisht verity . was i a pastor , i my flock did feed and gently lead the lambs , as they had need . a captain i , with skill i train’d my band and shew’d them how in face of foes to stand . if a soldier , with speed i did obey as readily as could my leader say . was i a laborer , i wrought all day as cheerfully as ere i took my pay . thus hath mine age ( in all ) sometimes done well ; sometimes mine age ( in all ) been worse than hell . in meanness , greatness , riches , poverty did toil , did broil ; oppress’d , did steal and lie . was i as poor as poverty could be , then baseness was companion unto me . such scum as hedges and high - ways do yield , as neither sow , nor reap , nor plant , nor build . if to agriculture i was ordain’d , great labours , sorrows , crosses i sustain’d . the early cock did summon , but in vain , my wakeful thoughts up to my painful gain . for restless day and night , i’m robb’d of sleep by cankered care , who sentinel doth keep . my weary breast rest from his toil can find , but if i rest , the more distrest my mind . if happiness my sordidness hath found , ‘twas in the crop of my manured ground : my fatted ox , and my exuberous cow , my fleeced ewe , and ever farrowing sow . to greater things i never did aspire , my dunghill thoughts or hopes could reach no higher . if to be rich , or great , it was my fate . how was i broil’d with envy , and with hate ? greater than was the great’st was my desire , and greater still , did set my heart on fire . if honour was the point to which i steer’d , to run my hull upon disgrace i fear’d , but by ambitious sails i was so carried that over flats , and sands , and rocks i hurried , opprest , and sunk , and sack’d , all in my way that did oppose me to my longed bay . my thirst was higher than nobility and oft long’d sore to taste on royalty , whence poison , pistols , and dread instruments have been curst furtherers of mine intents . nor brothers , nephews , sons , nor sires i’ve spar’d . when to a monarchy my way they barr'’d , there set , i rid my self straight out of hand of such as might my son , or his withstand , then heapt up gold and riches as the clay , which others scatter like the dew in may . sometimes vain - glory is the only bait whereby my empty school is lur’d and caught . be i of worth , of learning , or of parts , i judge i should have room in all men’s hearts ; and envy gnaws if any do surmount . i hate for to be had in small account . if bias like , i’m stript unto my skin ; i glory in my wealth i have within . thus good , and bad , and what i am , you see , now in a word , what my diseases be : the vexing stone , in bladder and in reins , torments me with intolerable pains ; the windy cholic oft my bowels rend , to break the darksome prison , where it’s penn’d ; the knotty gout doth sadly torture me , and the restraining lame sciatica ; the quinsy and the fevers often distaste me , and the consumption to the bones doth waste me , subject to all diseases , that’s the truth , though some more incident to age , or youth ; and to conclude , i may not tedious be , man at his best estate is vanity . old age what you have been , ev’n such have i before , and all you say , say i , and something more . babe's innocence , youth’s wildness i have seen , and in perplexed middle - age have been , sickness , dangers , and anxieties have past , and on this stage am come to act my last . i have been young , and strong , and wise as you but now , bis pueri senes is too true . in every age i’ve found much vanity . an end of all perfection now i see . it’s not my valour , honour , nor my gold , my ruin’d house , now falling can uphold ; it’s not my learning , rhetoric , wit so large , now hath the power , death’s warfare , to discharge . it’s not my goodly house , nor bed of down , that can refresh , or ease , if conscience frown ; nor from alliance now can i have hope , but what i have done well , that is my prop . he that in youth is godly , wise , and sage provides a staff for to support his age . great mutations , some joyful , and some sad , in this short pilgrimage i oft have had . sometimes the heavens with plenty smil’d on me , sometimes , again , rain’d all adversity ; sometimes in honour , sometimes in disgrace , sometime an abject , then again in place : such private changes oft mine eyes have seen . in various times of state i’ve also been . i’ve seen a kingdom flourish like a tree when it was rul’d by that celestial she , and like a cedar others so surmount that but for shrubs they did themselves account . then saw i france , and holland sav’d , calais won , and philip and albertus half undone . i saw all peace at home , terror to foes , but ah , i saw at last those eyes to close , and then , me thought , the world at noon grew dark when it had lost that radiant sun - like spark . in midst of griefs , i saw some hopes revive ( for ‘twas our hopes then kept our hearts alive ) ; i saw hopes dash’t , our forwardness was shent , and silenc’d we , by act of parliament . i’ve seen from rome , an execrable thing , a plot to blow up nobles and their king . i’ve seen designs at ree and cades cross’t , and poor palatinate for every lost . i’ve seen a prince to live on others’ lands , a royal one , by alms from subjects’ hands . i’ve seen base men , advanc’d to great degree , and worthy ones , put to extremity , but not their prince’s love , nor state so high , could once reverse , their shameful destiny . i’ve seen one stabb’d , another lose his head , and others fly their country through their dread . i’ve seen , and so have ye , for ‘tis but late , the desolation of a goodly state . plotted and acted so that none can tell who gave the counsell , but the prince of hell . i’ve seen a land unmoulded with great pain , but yet may live to see’t made up again . i’ve seen it shaken , rent , and soak’d in blood , but out of troubles ye may see much good . these are no old wives’ tales , but this is truth . we old men love to tell , what’s done in youth . but i return from whence i stept awry ; my memory is short and brain is dry . my almond - tree ( gray hairs ) doth flourish now , and back , once straight , begins apace to bow . my grinders now are few , my sight doth fail , my skin is wrinkled , and my cheeks are pale . no more rejoice , at music’s pleasant noise , but do awake at the cock’s clanging voice . i cannot scent savours of pleasant meat , nor sapors find in what i drink or eat . my hands and arms , once strong , have lost their might . i cannot labour , nor i cannot fight : my comely legs , as nimble as the roe , now stiff and numb , can hardly creep or go . my heart sometimes as fierce , as lion bold , now trembling , and fearful , sad , and cold . my golden bowl and silver cord , e’re long , shall both be broke , by wracking death so strong . i then shall go whence i shall come no more . sons , nephews , leave , my death for to deplore . in pleasures , and in labours , i have found that earth can give no consolation sound to great , to rich , to poor , to young , or old , to mean , to noble , fearful , or to bold . from king to beggar , all degrees shall find but vanity , vexation of the mind . yea , knowing much , the pleasant’st life of all hath yet amongst that sweet , some bitter gall . though reading others’ works doth much refresh , yet studying much brings weariness to th’ flesh . my studies , labours , readings all are done , and my last period can e’en elmost run . corruption , my father , i do call , mother , and sisters both ; the worms that crawl in my dark house , such kindred i have store . there i shall rest till heavens shall be no more ; and when this flesh shall rot and be consum’d , this body , by this soul , shall be assum’d ; and i shall see with these same very eyes my strong redeemer coming in the skies . triumph i shall , o’re sin , o’re death , o’re hell , and in that hope , i bid you all farewell .

"since it always begins in the unlikeliest place we start in an obsolete country on no current map . the camera glides over flower beds , for this is a southern climate . we focus on medals , a horse , on a white uniform , for this is june . the young man waves to the people lining the road , he lifts a child , he catches a rose from a wrinkled woman in a blue kerchief . then we hear shots and close in on a casket draped in the austrian flag . thirty - one days torn off a calendar . bombs on belgrade ; then europe explodes . we watch the trenches fill with men , the air with live ammunition . a close - up of a five - year - old living on turnips . her older sister , my not - yet - mother , already wearing my daughter’s eyes , is reading a letter as we cut to a young man with thick glasses who lies in a trench and writes a study of ibsen . i recognize him , he is going to be my father , and this is his way of keeping alive . snow . blood . lice . frostbite . grenades . stretchers . coffins . snow . telegrams with black borders . on the wide screen my father returns bringing his brother’s body ; my mother’s father brings back his son’s from the opposite edge . they come together under the oaks of the cemetery . all who will be my family are here , except my sister , who is not yet imagined . neither am i , who imagine this picture , who now jump to my snowy birthday in the year of the million - mark loaf of bread . my early years are played by a blue - eyed child who grows up quickly , for this is a film of highlights , like all documentaries false to the life — the work of selective memory , all i can bear of a painful childhood . the swastika appears and remains as the huge backdrop against which we’re seen . the sound track of a hysterical voice is threatening us . we’re heard as whispers . shortly before my city bursts into flames , my stand - in disappears from the film , which continues with scenes of terror and death i can’t bear to watch . i pick up a new reel , a strange sequel set in a different location and made in another language , in which i am back . the colors are bright , the sound track is filled with music , the focus gentle . a man is beside me . time - lapse photography picks up the inchmeal growth of daughters toward the sky , the slow subversion of dark by gray hair . little happens . the camera sums up the even flow of many years in a shot of a river . the principals from part one are missing , except for me who am the connection . the time is now , and i am playing myself .

"warning : this is very long . i have kind of gone on a rant here , but i do not expect anyone to respond . i am not asking a question with this , i just do not know where to put my emotions . i'm a freshman in highschool . 14 , female . i have had symptoms of depression and mild anxiety for the past 3 years or so , and i have been diagnosed with add ( attention deficit disorder ) . i am currently on medication for all 3 , but i still find myself hating life with a burning passion . i feel so worthless and lazy . i get overwhelmed by the workload from my school every damn week , and it is hurting me . i just want to sleep , like , forever . i just want to sleep and get away from everything . but deep down , i know i shouldn't , and i can't . i have dragged myself through my own tears trying to have a good academic lifestyle . i have got so much pressure on me , with me going to a magnet school that is strict about grades , and having to get a full or near - full scholarship to a college since i will never be able to pay off the monster that is student loans , because money matters so much in this stupid dumpster fire of a world . i cannot kill myself because i am scared . i know it would hurt my family members ; though they do not seem to show it in daily life when i am "" fine "" . despite the fact she knows i am an emotional mess and i have cut myself before , my mother does not seem to get it . i love her , but every single day she makes my problems worse . she screams when she is pissed off , of course , but she also says hurtful things to me a lot . i get called "" worthless "" , "" lazy sack of shit "" , and worst of all , "" i wish you were never born . "" she's apologized each time she is said it ( though only after i talk to her about how much it hurts me , after she leaves for an hour or two ) . my family just does not take my emotions seriously . "" it's not that hard , just do it ! "" my mother always says when i am crying over my homework and projects at 1 am . she is been through school , yet it seems like she will never understand the pain it causes me . so , i end up cutting myself . my emotions get so high , that i eventually go almost mentally "" numb "" and i cut . i cut scars that run as deep as the hurt that my daily life causes me . it's just too much . i need to get away from life . i just want to sleep for a very long time , or forever . i try , and try , and try , but it never gets easier . i used to like school in elementary . after i went through my first year of middle school , i was a changed person . my only real friends started to leave with the popular kids as their interests change . we were no longer a group of weird kids that loved to hang out and talk about my little pony or warriors . they abandoned me , which is bound to happen with any friend group eventually , but i have not been able to find my new place . it is so hard for me to socialize now that i would rather stay home and dream about having friends that understand me . i get my schoolwork done , and i just feel so tired . it takes hours for me to do something that takes most students less than one or two hours . my add makes it so i cannot think straight , even on meds . if it is not mentally stimulating , like watching tv or drawing , my brain decides to shut down and go blank where there were once racing thoughts . you can guess how i do with math work . i still get distracted , too , so i get way off track and procrastinate on my work . i stay up until i am about to pass out just so i can have a few more hours of that sweet freedom before i have to wake up and go through hell again . add all that up , plus going through my awkward phase of maturing , and i am emotionally drained . i break down . i cannot function right . i'm pretty lonely , too . i have people online i talk to occasionally , but i have not had a best friend whose shoulder i could lean on since 5th grade . her interests changed , so she is been distancing herself from me . my friends have all "" outgrown "" their phases , but i never did . i still enjoy mlp every once in a while , i play "" cringey "" games like roblox , and i am a furry . i cannot even tell people my interests without sounding like a loser anyway , so i have never found any other weirdos to be friends with . so there is that too . but i am also figuring out my preferences . i have always had "" crushes "" on boys , like maybe 3 in my lifetime , and one was in kindergarten . i just though they had cute faces and my heart fluttered a little , but as soon as i imagine kissing or cuddling with a man i am turned off . i could see myself being happy with a woman , however . i love being feminine , and i am always pretty distressed about my appearance because let us be real , no matter what people say to make me feel better , you gotta admit i am pretty ugly , lol . i could see myself when i am older , being skinnier , with hair that is no longer greasy and terrible after i just washed it . i could see myself with an attractive woman , with long , curly brown hair and a cute freckly face . i would want someone who enjoys dressing and acting feminine , but is not hetero . that would be very hard , probably . especially since they would need to understand my add and still love me even if i am forgetful or i have a mental breakdown . i need someone to really love me . but i am so afraid that i will never achieve that . i am fat , ugly , and i have terrible misaligned teeth because we cannot afford to get me braces again , since i am adamant on having the "" invisible "" ones that do not ruin nice or formal looks . i want to be straight . it would make life easier for me . i talked to my mom about my feelings , and she seemed to not like the idea of me possibly liking and marrying a woman in the future . she wants a blood grandchild . she seems to think sexuality and romantic orientations are the same , even when i told her that you do not have to do the things that repulse me to love someone . i cannot imagine myself cuddling or kissing a man , but i can with a woman . she does not seem to believe me , which i think is due to the blood child thing . i am making this on an alt in order to remain anonymous . i do not expect any commentary , i just need to fucking vent right now to somebody . i am not sure what to even do with my life at this point , it is just broken me . i am broken .

"well , in a first place . id like to say sorry if sometimes i make grammar mistakes , english is not my main language . also , i know most people might think i am exaggerating . i met my best friend some years ago , by the time i did not use to have many friends . its kinda funny but even if we were pretty different in a lot of aspects , we become friends since day 1 . along this years , he helped me with a lot of issues because of some family and personal problems . i felt in blue , with a lot of negative feelings ( i wont confirm if i was actually depressed , cause i never went to an specialist to determine so ) . at the same time , he also struggled with depression ( in his case , it was confirmed ) and he used to take a lot of pills to treat it . as friends , we were pretty aware with our emotions , and we use to have a lot of trust each other . one day , i was feeling like shit , and i felt it was better just to kill myself and let everything go , i was going to hang myself . but he came into my rescue and make realized there were a lot of motives to live , like fighting to reach my goals , reminding me about the special people that actually care for me , etc . ( till now , his words keep inspiring me to keep doing what i love , which is being at film school , trying to reach my dreams ) . this school in which i am studying is in argentina ( im from peru ) , which eventually made me move into this country this year . once ive moved , we still in contact , but not as much as we where when i was in peru . ( we actually use to met each other almost every single day ) . so ( id like to think ) thats the reason he wasnt that open with me once i left . 2 months ago , her gf text me a dm telling me he was dead . at the very first beginning i did not believe in her thinking he took her phone to make me a prank ( he used to have a very dark humor , which is the reason i believed so ) but she send me a vn crying , telling me their family just found out he hanged himself . that night i felt like garbage , and it did not help the fact that after the bad news i got fucked up with liquor . most of the time i feel guilty mostly because i wasnt able to safe him , just like he did with me . he trusted me , and even if i left to reach my personal goals , i know i wont see him again , and worst . i know i ll never say goodbye to him . nowadays , i do not feel blue or even sad . ive already realised that its over , that my best friend will be only a memory . and even if it was his choice , its impossible for me not to wonder what would have happened if maybe i wouldnt have left . all i care , is the fact that we will never work on a movie as we planned . ill never see his kids . i wont go to the beach , or even to the park to smoke a joint with him . we will never have a beer together . we will never see each other in the altar with our couples . i will never see my friend , the first one i had that i can call a brother more than a friend . rip sebastian .

"three summers since i chose a maid , too young maybe — but more’s to do at harvest - time than bide and woo . when us was wed she turned afraid of love and me and all things human ; like the shut of a winter’s day her smile went out , and ’twadn’t a woman — more like a little frightened fay . one night , in the fall , she runned away . “ out ’mong the sheep , her be , ” they said , ’should properly have been abed ; but sure enough she wadn’t there lying awake with her wide brown stare . so over seven - acre field and up - along across the down we chased her , flying like a hare before out lanterns . to church - town all in a shiver and a scare we caught her , fetched her home at last and turned the key upon her , fast . she does the work about the house as well as most , but like a mouse : happy enough to chat and play with birds and rabbits and such as they , so long as men - folk keep away . “ not near , not near ! ” her eyes beseech when one of us comes within reach . the women say that beasts in stall look round like children at her call . i’ve hardly heard her speak at all . shy as a leveret , swift as he , straight and slight as a young larch tree , sweet as the first wild violets , she , to her wild self . but what to me ? the short days shorten and the oaks are brown , the blue smoke rises to the low grey sky , one leaf in the still air falls slowly down , a magpie’s spotted feathers lie on the black earth spread white with rime , the berries redden up to christmas - time . what’s christmas - time without there be some other in the house than we ! she sleeps up in the attic there alone , poor maid . ’tis but a stair betwixt us . oh ! my god ! the down , the soft young down of her , the brown , the brown of her — her eyes , her hair , her hair !

"it’s 3 am here and i’m still awake because i just feel like a big mistake . i’m honestly really really scared of dying because i’m scared of pain and i don’t want to hurt my mom who is probably the only person left who cares about me , somewhat but i feel like it’s the only option left for me . i can’t help but feel like i constantly make my mom want to kill herself , since she says it basically every day . i’m tired of constantly disappointing her and generally always breaking her heart because i decided to be selfish . i don’t even try at anything i do and i’m not good at anything , i’m just a waste of space . i feel like if i don’t die i’ll constantly make everyone around me suffer like i always do . i don’t even have any friends who talk to me outside of school unless i text them myself and even then i feel like people are just so tired of me and honestly i would be tired of myself too . i’m constantly screwing myself and other people over and i’m so sick of it . i want it to stop . i hate that i’m so scared of dying but at the same time it physically and mentally hurts for me to keep existing . i’m just so tired . i’m so done with this . what’s the point of living ? i can’t see the “ good ” that is supposedly there . every single day i grow more and more tired of myself and the life i’m living . nothing gets better . everything just decides to constantly get worse out of my control , and even the things in my control go wrong because i mess up , because of course i do . i’m stuck in this endless limbo of being afraid of death and having guilt for even thinking about putting my mom through more shit and bad things than she has been going through already but i feel like just my own existence is also constantly making people miserable . it’s a lose - lose . . . i stay alive and make my mom miserable because i’m a disappointment and a failure and if i die i’ll probably make her more miserable . i just want it to stop . i want to lie down and never wake up again . i’m sorry for ranting and talking so much about things that probably don’t matter that much , i’m sorry for wasting your time and i’m sorry for being a bother .

"1 sometime now past in the autumnal tide , when phoebus wanted but one hour to bed , the trees all richly clad , yet void of pride , were gilded o’re by his rich golden head . their leaves and fruits seem’d painted but was true of green , of red , of yellow , mixed hew , rapt were my senses at this delectable view . 2 i wist not what to wish , yet sure thought i , if so much excellence abide below , how excellent is he that dwells on high ? whose power and beauty by his works we know . sure he is goodness , wisdom , glory , light , that hath this under world so richly dight . more heaven than earth was here , no winter and no night . 3 then on a stately oak i cast mine eye , whose ruffling top the clouds seem’d to aspire ; how long since thou wast in thine infancy ? thy strength and stature , more thy years admire , hath hundred winters past since thou wast born ? or thousand since thou brakest thy shell of horn , if so , all these as nought , eternity doth scorn . 4 then higher on the glistering sun i gaz’d , whose beams was shaded by the leafy tree . the more i look’d , the more i grew amaz’d and softly said , what glory’s like to thee ? soul of this world , this universe’s eye , no wonder some made thee a deity : had i not better known ( alas ) the same had i . 5 thou as a bridegroom from thy chamber rushes and as a strong man joys to run a race . the morn doth usher thee with smiles and blushes . the earth reflects her glances in thy face . birds , insects , animals with vegative , thy heat from death and dullness doth revive : and in the darksome womb of fruitful nature dive . 6 thy swift annual and diurnal course , thy daily straight and yearly oblique path , thy pleasing fervour , and thy scorching force , all mortals here the feeling knowledge hath . thy presence makes it day , thy absence night , quaternal seasons caused by thy might : hail creature , full of sweetness , beauty , and delight . 7 art thou so full of glory that no eye hath strength thy shining rays once to behold ? and is thy splendid throne erect so high ? as , to approach it , can no earthly mould . how full of glory then must thy creator be ? who gave this bright light luster unto thee : admir’d , ador’d for ever be that majesty . 8 silent alone where none or saw , or heard , in pathless paths i lead my wand’ring feet . my humble eyes to lofty skies i rear’d to sing some song my mazed muse thought meet . my great creator i would magnifie , that nature had thus decked liberally : but ah and ah again , my imbecility ! 9 i heard the merry grasshopper then sing , the black clad cricket bear a second part . they kept one tune and played on the same string , seeming to glory in their little art . shall creatures abject thus their voices raise ? and in their kind resound their maker’s praise : whilst i , as mute , can warble forth no higher layes . 10 when present times look back to ages past and men in being fancy those are dead , it makes things gone perpetually to last and calls back months and years that long since fled it makes a man more aged in conceit , than was methuselah or’s grand - sire great : while of their persons and their acts his mind doth treat . 11 sometimes in eden fair he seems to be , see glorious adam there made lord of all , fancies the apple , dangle on the tree , that turn’d his sovereign to a naked thrall , who like a miscreant’s driven from that place to get his bread with pain and sweat of face : a penalty impos’d on his backsliding race . 12 here sits our grandame in retired place , and in her lap her bloody cain new born , the weeping imp oft looks her in the face , bewails his unknown hap and fate forlorn ; his mother sighs to think of paradise , and how she lost her bliss , to be more wise , believing him that was , and is , father of lyes . 13 here cain and abel come to sacrifice , fruits of the earth and fatlings each do bring , on abels gift the fire descends from skies , but no such sign on false cain’s offering ; with sullen hateful looks he goes his wayes . hath thousand thoughts to end his brothers dayes , upon whose blood his future good he hopes to raise . 14 there abel keeps his sheep , no ill he thinks , his brother comes , then acts his fratricide . the virgin earth of blood her first draught drinks , but since that time she often hath been cloy’d ; the wretch with ghastly face and dreadful mind , thinks each he sees will serve him in his kind , though none on earth but kindred near then could he find . 15 who fancies not his looks now at the barr , his face like death , his heart with horror fraught , nor male - factor ever felt like warr , when deep despair with wish of life hath fought , branded with guilt , and crusht with treble woes , a vagabond to land of nod he goes . a city builds , that wals might him secure from foes . 16 who thinks not oft upon the fathers ages . their long descent , how nephews sons they saw , the starry observations of those sages , and how their precepts to their sons were law , how adam sigh’d to see his progeny , cloath’d all in his black , sinful livery , who neither guilt not yet the punishment could fly . 17 our life compare we with their length of dayes who to the tenth of theirs doth now arrive ? and though thus short , we shorten many wayes , living so little while we are alive ; in eating , drinking , sleeping , vain delight so unawares comes on perpetual night , and puts all pleasures vain unto eternal flight . 18 when i behold the heavens as in their prime , and then the earth ( though old ) still clad in green , the stones and trees , insensible of time , nor age nor wrinkle on their front are seen ; if winter come , and greenness then do fade , a spring returns , and they more youthfull made ; but man grows old , lies down , remains where once he’s laid . 19 by birth more noble than those creatures all , yet seems by nature and by custom curs’d , no sooner born , but grief and care makes fall that state obliterate he had at first : nor youth , nor strength , nor wisdom spring again nor habitations long their names retain , but in oblivion to the final day remain . 20 shall i then praise the heavens , the trees , the earth because their beauty and their strength last longer shall i wish there , or never to had birth , because they’re bigger and their bodyes stronger ? nay , they shall darken , perish , fade and dye , and when unmade , so ever shall they lye , but man was made for endless immortality . 21 under the cooling shadow of a stately elm close sate i by a goodly rivers side , where gliding streams the rocks did overwhelm ; a lonely place , with pleasures dignifi’d . i once that lov’d the shady woods so well , now thought the rivers did the trees excel , and if the sun would ever shine , there would i dwell . 22 while on the stealing stream i fixt mine eye , which to the long’d - for ocean held its course , i markt , nor crooks , nor rubs that there did lye could hinder ought but still augment its force : o happy flood , quoth i , that holds thy race till thou arrive at thy beloved place , nor is it rocks or shoals that can obstruct thy pace . 23 nor is’t enough that thou alone may’st slide , but hundred brooks in thy cleer waves do meet , so hand in hand along with thee they glide to thetis house , where all imbrace and greet : thou emblem true of what i count the best , o could i lead my rivolets to rest , so may we press to that vast mansion , ever blest . 24 ye fish which in this liquid region ’bide that for each season have your habitation , now salt , now fresh where you think best to glide to unknown coasts to give a visitation , in lakes and ponds , you leave your numerous fry , so nature taught , and yet you know not why , you watry folk that know not your felicity . 25 look how the wantons frisk to tast the air , then to the colder bottome streight they dive , eftsoon to neptun’s glassy hall repair to see what trade they , great ones , there do drive , who forrage o’re the spacious sea - green field , and take the trembling prey before it yield , whose armour is their scales , their spreading fins their shield . 26 while musing thus with contemplation fed , and thousand fancies buzzing in my brain , the sweet - tongu’d philomel percht ore my head , and chanted forth a most melodious strain which rapt me so with wonder and delight , i judg’d my hearing better than my sight , and wisht me wings with her a while to take my flight . 27 o merry bird ( said i ) that fears no snares , that neither toyles nor hoards up in thy barn , feels no sad thoughts , nor cruciating cares to gain more good , or shun what might thee harm thy clothes ne’re wear , thy meat is every where , thy bed a bough , thy drink the water cleer , reminds not what is past , nor whats to come dost fear . 28 the dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent , sets hundred notes unto thy feathered crew , so each one tunes his pretty instrument , and warbling out the old , begin anew , and thus they pass their youth in summer season , then follow thee into a better region , where winter’s never felt by that sweet airy legion . 29 man at the best a creature frail and vain , in knowledge ignorant , in strength but weak , subject to sorrows , losses , sickness , pain , each storm his state , his mind , his body break , from some of these he never finds cessation , but day or night , within , without , vexation , troubles from foes , from friends , from dearest , near’st relation . 30 and yet this sinfull creature , frail and vain , this lump of wretchedness , of sin and sorrow , this weather - beaten vessel wrackt with pain , joys not in hope of an eternal morrow ; nor all his losses , crosses and vexation , in weight , in frequency and long duration can make him deeply groan for that divine translation . 31 the mariner that on smooth waves doth glide , sings merrily and steers his barque with ease , as if he had command of wind and tide , and now becomes great master of the seas ; but suddenly a storm spoils all the sport , and makes him long for a more quiet port , which ’gainst all adverse winds may serve for fort . 32 so he that faileth in this world of pleasure , feeding on sweets , that never bit of th’ sowre , that’s full of friends , of honour and of treasure , fond fool , he takes this earth ev’n for heav’ns bower , but sad affliction comes and makes him see here’s neither honour , wealth , nor safety ; only above is found all with security . 33 o time the fatal wrack of mortal things , that draws oblivions curtains over kings , their sumptuous monuments , men know them not , their names without a record are forgot , their parts , their ports , their pomp’s all laid in th’ dust . nor wit , nor gold , nor buildings scape times rust ; but he whose name is grav’d in the white stone shall last and shine when all of these are gone .

"i'm 13 , and i do not know god decided he wanted someone to suffer so he made me trans and gave me misophonia . i have already attempted , but did not fucking die , just suffered , the person that was most important to me left me and i traumatized my family . i need puberty blockers or testosterone but my parents wont let me because of some retarded side effects that barely exist so i starve myself instead . because that is healthier , apparently . it is not even what i am depressed about , i do not have a appetite anymore . it's that i am wasting my life away . i am supposed to be happy , joking with my friends . i am supposed to get a girlfriend , and playing videogames , and whatever people my age do . not staying in my room with loud music to drown out my sisters shit , logging calories for a sugar free energy drink and ignoring my friends and family because i am too depressed to talk to them . since i turned 7 my life just went to shit . and i cannot remember anything before that . i am going to look back at what are supposed to be my prime , childhood years are this . i want to die . but if i kill myself i will just survive and hurt people more it wont achieve anything . [ in the middle of writing this fucking post my mom said shes doing this because she cares about me . ( not giving me puberty blockers ) i have to live my life like this because they are do not want me having brain damage or stroke when there were few cases of that . i am so fucking done . ] so . . i am just here wasting away until i can have legal permission to live ( get healthcare for myself because nobody knows how i feel . ) i'm not mad . i am not sad . i am just tired and so done . i cannot do this , but i will because my parents are so selfish . they are not but from my perspective they are . they make me live like this because they do not want me to kill myself but do not want to give me blockers either . so i will just keep living and hope this starvation is slowly killing me , because that seems the best way out . anyways , how are you ?

" hello , people . i've had severe depression and anxiety for at least 9 years now . before that i was not happy either . had a suicide attempt 9 months ago . spent a month in a psychiatric hospital , where all the "" help "" i got was not being able to do it again for that whole month , because i was being observed 24 / 7 . i've been on several medications , antidepresants , antipsychotics , mood stabilizers , benzos . nothing helps . mb benzos help with anxiety a bit , but that is not a good solution to the problem , not a long term one anyway . i live in a shitty country with such salaries that i would have to work full time to be able to cover only the cost of therapy . i am seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis , though . i'm 23 rn , i dropped from secondary ( high ) school 3 times , now i am in the program again + taking some courses , it is all torture . therefore , i am at my lowest point again . i can talk about this forever , but the main point is : if i cannot work , cannot study , cannot have fun , cannot socialize , cannot simply lay down and relax , what is the point ? i was never happy and things are only getting worse . since i am in such a bad situation rn , if i drop out again i will feel worse , i cannot stop taking those courses , because i will have to pay full price if i do not finish them , i do not have that money . this feels like a perfect time to do something stupid . the only thing that is holding me back is my partner , i do not want to hurt them . but i do not imagine a life together either , not with a person like me . i do not know what to do . also , i am hardly motivated to do anything . but . . . any suggestions ? anything ?

was the thing done ? — then , what is to do again ? see , in the chequered pavement opposite , suppose the artist made a perfect rhomb , and next a lozenge , then a trapezoid — he did not overlay them , superimpose the new upon the old and blot it out , but laid them on a level in his work , making at last a picture ; there it lies . so , first the perfect separate forms were made , the portions of mankind ; and after , so , occurred the combination of the same . for where had been a progress , otherwise ? mankind , made up of all the single men , — in such a synthesis the labour ends . now mark me ! those divine men of old time have reached , thou sayest well , each at one point the outside verge that rounds our faculty ; and where they reached , who can do more than reach ? it takes but little water just to touch at some one point the inside of a sphere , and , as we turn the sphere , touch all the rest in due succession : but the finer air which not so palpably nor obviously , though no less universally , can touch the whole circumference of that emptied sphere , fills it more fully than the water did ; holds thrice the weight of water in itself resolved into a subtler element . and yet the vulgar call the sphere first full up to the visible height — and after , void ; not knowing air's more hidden properties . and thus our soul , misknown , cries out to zeus to vindicate his purpose in our life : why stay we on the earth unless to grow ? long since , i imaged , wrote the fiction out , that he or other god descended here and , once for all , showed simultaneously what , in its nature , never can be shown , piecemeal or in succession ; — showed , i say , the worth both absolute and relative of all his children from the birth of time , his instruments for all appointed work . i now go on to image , — might we hear the judgment which should give the due to each , show where the labour lay and where the ease , and prove zeus' self , the latent everywhere ! this is a dream : — but no dream , let us hope , that years and days , the summers and the springs , follow each other with unwaning powers . the grapes which dye thy wine are richer far , through culture , than the wild wealth of the rock ; the suave plum than the savage - tasted drupe ; the pastured honey - bee drops choicer sweet ; the flowers turn double , and the leaves turn flowers ; that young and tender crescent - moon , thy slave , sleeping above her robe as buoyed by clouds , refines upon the women of my youth . what , and the soul alone deteriorates ? i have not chanted verse like homer , no — nor swept string like terpander , no — nor carved and painted men like phidias and his friend : i am not great as they are , point by point . but i have entered into sympathy with these four , running these into one soul , who , separate , ignored each other's art . say , is it nothing that i know them all ? the wild flower was the larger ; i have dashed rose - blood upon its petals , pricked its cup's honey with wine , and driven its seed to fruit , and show a better flower if not so large : i stand myself . refer this to the gods whose gift alone it is ! which , shall i dare ( all pride apart ) upon the absurd pretext that such a gift by chance lay in my hand , discourse of lightly or depreciate ? it might have fallen to another's hand : what then ? i pass too surely : let at least truth stay ! and next , of what thou followest on to ask . this being with me as i declare , o king , my works , in all these varicoloured kinds , so done by me , accepted so by men — thou askest , if ( my soul thus in men's hearts ) i must not be accounted to attain the very crown and proper end of life ? inquiring thence how , now life closeth up , i face death with success in my right hand : whether i fear death less than dost thyself the fortunate of men ? "" for "" ( writest thou ) "" thou leavest much behind , while i leave nought . thy life stays in the poems men shall sing , the pictures men shall study ; while my life , complete and whole now in its power and joy , dies altogether with my brain and arm , is lost indeed ; since , what survives myself ? the brazen statue to o'erlook my grave , set on the promontory which i named . and that — some supple courtier of my heir shall use its robed and sceptred arm , perhaps , to fix the rope to , which best drags it down . i go then : triumph thou , who dost not go ! "" nay , thou art worthy of hearing my whole mind . is this apparent , when thou turn'st to muse upon the scheme of earth and man in chief , that admiration grows as knowledge grows ? that imperfection means perfection hid , reserved in part , to grace the after - time ? if , in the morning of philosophy , ere aught had been recorded , nay perceived , thou , with the light now in thee , couldst have looked on all earth's tenantry , from worm to bird , ere man , her last , appeared upon the stage — thou wouldst have seen them perfect , and deduced the perfectness of others yet unseen . conceding which , — had zeus then questioned thee , "" shall i go on a step , improve on this , do more for visible creatures than is done ? "" thou wouldst have answered , "" ay , by making each grow conscious in himself — by that alone . all's perfect else : the shell sucks fast the rock , the fish strikes through the sea , the snake both swims and slides , forth range the beasts , the birds take flight , till life's mechanics can no further go — and all this joy in natural life is put like fire from off thy finger into each , so exquisitely perfect is the same . but 'tis pure fire , and they mere matter are ; it has them , not they it : and so i choose for man , thy last premeditated work ( if i might add a glory to the scheme ) , that a third thing should stand apart from both , a quality arise within his soul , which , intro - active , made to supervise and feel the force it has , may view itself , and so be happy . "" man might live at first the animal life : but is there nothing more ? in due time , let him critically learn how he lives ; and , the more he gets to know of his own life's adaptabilities , the more joy - giving will his life become . thus man , who hath this quality , is best . but thou , king , hadst more reasonably said : "" let progress end at once , — man make no step beyond the natural man , the better beast , using his senses , not the sense of sense . "" in man there is failure , only since he left the lower and inconscious forms of life . we called it an advance , the rendering plain man's spirit might grow conscious of man's life , and , by new lore so added to the old , take each step higher over the brute's head . this grew the only life , the pleasure - house , watch - tower and treasure - fortress of the soul , which whole surrounding flats of natural life seemed only fit to yield subsistence to ; a tower that crowns a country . but alas , the soul now climbs it just to perish there ! for thence we have discovered ( 'tis no dream — we know this , which we had not else perceived ) that there is a world of capability for joy , spread round about us , meant for us , inviting us ; and still the soul craves all , and still the flesh replies , "" take no jot more than ere thou clombst the tower to look abroad ! nay , so much less as that fatigue has brought deduction to it . "" we struggle , fain to enlarge our bounded physical recipiency , increase our power , supply fresh oil to life , repair the waste of age and sickness : no , it skills not ! life's inadequate to joy , as the soul sees joy , tempting life to take . they praise a fountain in my garden here wherein a naiad sends the water - bow thin from her tube ; she smiles to see it rise . what if i told her , it is just a thread from that great river which the hills shut up , and mock her with my leave to take the same ? the artificer has given her one small tube past power to widen or exchange — what boots to know she might spout oceans if she could ? she cannot lift beyond her first thin thread : and so a man can use but a man's joy while he sees god's . is it for zeus to boast , "" see , man , how happy i live , and despair — that i may be still happier — for thy use ! "" if this were so , we could not thank our lord , as hearts beat on to doing ; 'tis not so — malice it is not . is it carelessness ? still , no . if care — where is the sign ? i ask , and get no answer , and agree in sum , o king , with thy profound discouragement , who seest the wider but to sigh the more . most progress is most failure : thou sayest well . the last point now : — thou dost except a case — holding joy not impossible to one with artist - gifts — to such a man as i who leave behind me living works indeed ; for , such a poem , such a painting lives . what ? dost thou verily trip upon a word , confound the accurate view of what joy is ( caught somewhat clearer by my eyes than thine ) with feeling joy ? confound the knowing how and showing how to live ( my faculty ) with actually living ? — otherwise where is the artist's vantage o'er the king ? because in my great epos i display how divers men young , strong , fair , wise , can act — is this as though i acted ? if i paint , carve the young phoebus , am i therefore young ? methinks i am older that i bowed myself the many years of pain that taught me art ! indeed , to know is something , and to prove how all this beauty might be enjoyed , is more : but , knowing nought , to enjoy is something too . yon rower , with the moulded muscles there , lowering the sail , is nearer it than i . i can write love - odes : thy fair slave's an ode . i get to sing of love , when grown too grey for being beloved : she turns to that young man , the muscles all a - ripple on his back . i know the joy of kingship : well , thou art king ! "" but , "" sayest thou — ( and i marvel , i repeat , to find thee trip on such a mere word ) "" what thou writest , paintest , stays ; that does not die : sappho survives , because we sing her songs , and aeschylus , because we read his plays ! "" why , if they live still , let them come and take thy slave in my despite , drink from thy cup , speak in my place . thou diest while i survive ? say rather that my fate is deadlier still , in this , that every day my sense of joy grows more acute , my soul ( intensified by power and insight ) more enlarged , more keen ; while every day my hairs fall more and more , my hand shakes , and the heavy years increase — the horror quickening still from year to year , the consummation coming past escape , when i shall know most , and yet least enjoy — when all my works wherein i prove my worth , being present still to mock me in men's mouths , alive still , in the praise of such as thou , i , i the feeling , thinking , acting man , the man who loved his life so over - much , sleep in my urn . it is so horrible , i dare at times imagine to my need some future state revealed to us by zeus , unlimited in capability for joy , as this is in desire for joy , — to seek which , the joy - hunger forces us : that , stung by straitness of our life , made strait on purpose to make prized the life at large — freed by the throbbing impulse we call death , we burst there as the worm into the fly , who , while a worm still , wants his wings . but no ! zeus has not yet revealed it ; and alas , he must have done so , were it possible ! live long and happy , and in that thought die : glad for what was ! farewell . and for the rest , i cannot tell thy messenger aright where to deliver what he bears of thine to one called paulus ; we have heard his fame indeed , if christus be not one with him — i know not , nor am troubled much to know . thou canst not think a mere barbarian jew , as paulus proves to be , one circumcised , hath access to a secret shut from us ? thou wrongest our philosophy , o king , in stooping to inquire of such an one , as if his answer could impose at all ! he writeth , doth he ? well , and he may write . oh , the jew findeth scholars ! certain slaves who touched on this same isle , preached him and christ ; and ( as i gathered from a bystander ) their doctrine could be held by no sane man .

"sorry , this is my last note . i should have ended it like i wanted to 10 years ago , would have been better off not experiencing any of this . i've caught my girlfriend in bed with another dude , i have had too many failed relationships to count , i am weak . i thought exercising would fix this issue . it helped , i got the body i wanted , but nothing changed , and now i am back to my old , former , disgusting self . but that is not the problem here . see - i have a band , we make music . recently , after a decent concert - the band members decided to go full ape on me in front of the ex that betrayed me , saying that they are "" fed up "" with me failing , and quote / unquote "" everything is wrong with you "" . of course , nobody understood why the band decided to kick me out . the concert was fine except for the few hickups due to stress / worrying , and me being a bit hazy due to the new antidepressants i drink , but they do not care , all they hear are "" excuses "" . so they called me a "" toddler who cannot set up properly , a kid who needs to be watched "" . they did everything in front of my ex , which just topped the icing . i said if you take what i do for granted - i will leave . after i cooled off a bit - i said "" alright , let us try to fix this "" . they said no . now i was angry , but fine with this . i thought i will have to start anew , i still have my old songs . well they decided to take all of the songs i made with them too , citing it as the "" bands "" and "" they put effort into it "" ( even though i wrote 90 % of the material ) . worst of all - the other guitarist , the one i wanted to play with and i have been teaching him my songs - they have invited him . and as he says . "" i want to play in the more popular band instead of a new one , working with x has been easier than working with you "" . and , well . . . the ex that was in the concert agrees with them . so i have had my dream , my 4 years of hard work stolen , i have been betrayed by people i called close friends . i would think that the problem is me , if everyone else around would not disagree with them . but the thing is - them disagreeing does not change a thing . they say "" oh , those assholes - poor you ! "" . well , telling me that will not get the songs i made back . now the other guy abandoned me for them , because they are much more "" normal "" and "" prettier / better stage presence "" than me , stole everything i worked with towards my dream , and i am left with nothing . i'm interested to hear if anyone else had their dreams crushed again and again even if you try really hard by awful people , but my mind has been made up . i should have ended it a long time ago and saved everyone the trouble . life does not get better , it has not gotten better for the past 10 years , but i have always clinged on my dream of music , and now they have taken it too , so this is my goodbye , i really hope i will not piss out this time , just need to remember that it does not get better , people are awful , and if you want to make it through this world - you have to be awful too . i cannot bring myself to be awful , so i failed .

"i ( 19f ) have suicidal thoughts and i cannot get them out of my head . thing is , i am not depressed ( as far as i can judge that ) or suffer from anxiety or something . a rather harmless ocd , that is it . my life is going pretty well , graduated highschool with too grades and am going to go to college next month or so . i have a lovely cat that spends nearly all her time w me recently ( since lockdown ) and a cute horse to look after once in a while . i have an awesome best friend ( tho , she is more or less my only friend stm ) and my mom and my brother love me . there is no pain driving me towards suicide . but there is also nothing really holding me here , other than guilt and pain . i want to experience college , work a bit in the field i enjoy in the meanwhile , but i never planned to be alieve after that . i do not want to . what for ? on the other hand , i am scarred . of missing out . of disappointing people . of hurting my family . of leaving my cat alone . of the pain if it does not work . and , i mean , theres nothing really justifying a hypothetical suicide for me , is there ? i should be happy and full of joy and curious . and , some days , i am . i go for a walk and enjoy the green nature , or i read a nice book . i watch my favourite movies . and then again , those are just small moments of joy . some days i feel nothing , am just numb , some days i break down for no reason . i sob over small things or things that could be easily fixed . but those days seem pretty harmless to me , tho . nothing that would cause me to just exit . right now ; my cat is snorring beside of me , one leg on top of mine , looking extremely cute , and i feel like crying . because she makes it so much better and so much harder . i think the problem is just that i am s little too empathic , and the world is fu * * ed up , and the system is wrecked . who wants to spend their lives working for a system that does not reward you , being mad about the lack of freetime and joy ? why do so many put up with that ? i always wondered why so many people that have it so , so much worse put up with life . maybe because they have hope . i , too , have hope . sometimes hope wins , sometimes it is not enough . sometimes , i would be happy to find out what is there for me to come , but not at the cost of living . which does not make sense . my life is not hard . it is not painful . it is at best a bit difficult , but it is difficult for everybody . my family and my best friend , and my cat , are what is holding me back . i do not want to hurt them . i love them . i want to show them my love and feel loved , so i stick around . also , somehow , the fact that there is always an option , puts me at ease and gives me peace . why not experience college first ? you can let go after that . maybe , in five years , i will say "" why not experience working first ? you can let go after that "" . fact is , i did not move out for college like i wanted to . i would love that . but i would also hate it . and i am afraid i would break down and , well , maybe finally do it . and the thing is , while i am not scarred of dying or missing out ( not much ) , i am incredibly scarred of doing that to my family . what it will do to my mom . her mother killed herself , and she made it trough , but another suicide ? what would she think ? that it is her fault for letting me go , for not talking to me more often ? no . i know that i cannot do it , not now anyways , so i do not move out . maybe i will feel different in a few years . maybe i will move far away and contact loosens , maybe that would hurt her less . and me ? knowing that that was the last time talking to her ? hearing her laugh ? she really is keeping me alive . and sometimes i am mad at her about that . it is that pain - those painful thoughts - that keep me from quitting . that is a good thing . but it also hurts . i do not know why i have those thoughts . i feel like an imposter . i should not have these thoughts . as if i just wished that people cared about me , even tho i know they do already , and i hate that feeling . it sounds as if i was just upset that life is no pony farm and react way extra . that is what i feel like . as if i was being extremely extra . and , well , a lot of people think of suicide once in a while , without being suicidal ( or so i read ) . and pointing out to myself that there is an option ( that could be used later in life ) also appears . . . pretty much harmless to me . which is why i do not talk about that , and why i did not want to post it in here originally , since i feel as if i offend / insult those who truly suffer from depression and are suicidal . thank you for reading til here . sorry for the long text .

"myth is prison , a palace , truth without fact . myth is birth and pleasure , teeth and death , sharp shiver of that which is broken . myth is patriarchal and worn , full of fratricide and rape . myth is a garden , makes good television , memoir , the scandal of animals and people coupling beneath the stars . myth is crow eating roadkill and dodging the occasional cars , a pile of guts and bones . myth is carrying the body back to the den . – close your eyes and count to ten . 1 . “ in language , there are always two . ” the iliad stolen from thoreau’s cabin , the only thing taken during those years . remember , too , the aenied ( we all have lived through times of war ) and that passage a friend said to know well , “ learn fortitude and toil from me , my son , ache of true toil . good fortune learn from others . ” 2 . ultrasound images of my heart . that it moves and moves and then moves again , plump muscle shuddering , laboring to make up for one bad valve . spots in the ocean where nothing lives and yet there is movement , water moving . i stand in the river fishing and watching an osprey slide through the air ten feet above the water . i hear those wings . 3 . eleven years of loving can’t just vanish . i have photographs . i have facts . “ hapy birthday dady ” scribbled on a card . how easy to sit at a desk and not see the full moon through the window . roy sullivan , virginia park ranger , struck by lightning seven times , kills himself after being dumped by a lover . “ present fears are less than horrible imaginings . ” a friend asks , “ why are you hiding in myth ? ” 4 . i gather a lock of his hair , a scrap of t - shirt , a baby tooth , his tiny spoon , a diaper pin with a blue plastic stork , the quilted blanket , his first steps , hands clutching my fingers , the long night when his fever rose to 104 ˚ , his split lip at age six when he jumped with outspread arms , the first shoe , a locket with a toddler photo , first day of school , first finger painting , the green cardboard sculpture like something shaped by breton , t - ball games , the flopping trout he squeezed too hard , his first broken bone , his fear when he felt my trembling hands trying to tell him something about the sun . 5 . trout with a slashed back where talons tore dorsal flesh and the flesh slipped from an osprey’s grip to a lucky landing in the creek’s waiting water , thrashing and calming , lingering beneath a deep cutbank , and weeks later , taking my elk hair caddis and leaping completely out of the water . on the far bank , a muskrat struggles and does a melodramatic gangster fall into the creek where it splashes and sinks . “ rattlesnake , ” my friend says , and i nod and stare at where the ripple swirls into the current and think about sinking bones . 6 . the court acknowledges the petitioner’s long involvement with _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ’s life and sincerely hopes that the parties involved will have the generosity and wisdom to honor that relationship . do not blame the wind that scatters apple blossoms ruthlessly . allow that flowers desire farewell blessings before their time has come . 7 . fishing in the desert creek a few days after the hearing , i find bones , steer skulls with round sockets for horns , and step near three rattlesnakes , almost grab a fourth when climbing a steep bank . the snakes were sluggish , though , late spring when the temperatures in the desert dipped into the thirties at night . only one rattled , and the rain of the previous days made the fishing terrible , water brown and swift . i didn’t get a bite and drove home , bought a bucket of fried chicken , and ate in front of the television his clothes still hanging in a closet . 8 . there is no end to the hours when cedars and peaks scratch the sky’s belly . no garden , but sometimes , wildflowers . sometimes , fish hold against the river’s current then dart with a silvery flash downstream . sometimes , deer on the other shore stand still for a moment , then hunch toward their grazing . 9 . a birthday party and he’ll have nothing to do with the inflatable castles rented and set up on the lawn , only wants to run all afternoon , playing chase , tag - like game where i growl and laugh and lumber around the playground , his giggling , both of us laughing and roaring , and i catch him and he gets away and climbs to the top of the jungle gym where he looks at me with worry , and i know that the game is on break , that this is real , and i walk beneath him and he doesn’t pause . he jumps into my arms , and i catch him . 10 . ready or nothere i come — a feather floats downstream , the rings of a ripple smooth . love is possible . the heron hunts in the shallows with slow deliberate steps , startles from the creek , and rises . sunlight warms basalt walls fields of sage , and hawthorne groves , here , where tumble - weeds rove for home .

"the green catalpa tree has turned all white ; the cherry blooms once more . in one whole year i haven’t learned a blessed thing they pay you for . the blossoms snow down in my hair ; the trees and i will soon be bare . the trees have more than i to spare . the sleek , expensive girls i teach , younger and pinker every year , bloom gradually out of reach . the pear tree lets its petals drop like dandruff on a tabletop . the girls have grown so young by now i have to nudge myself to stare . this year they smile and mind me how my teeth are falling with my hair . in thirty years i may not get younger , shrewder , or out of debt . the tenth time , just a year ago , i made myself a little list of all the things i’d ought to know , then told my parents , analyst , and everyone who’s trusted me i’d be substantial , presently . i haven’t read one book about a book or memorized one plot . or found a mind i did not doubt . i learned one date . and then forgot . and one by one the solid scholars get the degrees , the jobs , the dollars . and smile above their starchy collars . i taught my classes whitehead’s notions ; one lovely girl , a song of mahler’s . lacking a source - book or promotions , i showed one child the colors of a luna moth and how to love . i taught myself to name my name , to bark back , loosen love and crying ; to ease my woman so she came , to ease an old man who was dying . i have not learned how often i can win , can love , but choose to die . i have not learned there is a lie love shall be blonder , slimmer , younger ; that my equivocating eye loves only by my body’s hunger ; that i have forces , true to feel , or that the lovely world is real . while scholars speak authority and wear their ulcers on their sleeves , my eyes in spectacles shall see these trees procure and spend their leaves . there is a value underneath the gold and silver in my teeth . though trees turn bare and girls turn wives , we shall afford our costly seasons ; there is a gentleness survives that will outspeak and has its reasons . there is a loveliness exists , preserves us , not for specialists .

"things have really went downhill for me this past month or so . even more so than it was before . a month ago i had to let go of one of 2 cats ive had for nearly 20 years . his name was killer . he was my boy , but i did not get to spend much time with him cause he was in my mothers room and she is an alcoholic . her drinking really puts me in a very low and bad place so i actively avoid her when she is likely drunk . this cost me so much time with him , and i feel so fucking selfish that i let that stop me from giving him the time he deserved . around this time we had kinda had an intervention with my mother to get her to stop drinking and for a while it seemed like it may have actually worked . immediately after i lost killer , my other cat precious started to decline in health . she had a number of problems that sparked up after he left . i was taking care of her after that . i had to give her iv fluids , hand feel her with a syringe every few hours but she just got weaker and weaker . she could not really do anything for herself . 3 weeks after i let my boy go i decided it was time to let her go . i was going to do in home ethnicization . after i made the appointment i spent all day with her , but unfortunately she did not make it till then . she died in my arms naturally . as i said ive had these cats for nearly 20 years , since i was like 4 years old so losing them was the most painful thing i have been through , not to mention losing them both within a month of each other . now that ive lived without them for a week or so i realize that they have been my only source of affection in my life . i was lonely before but now its honestly physically painful how empty and alone i am . and to make things worse i found out that my mother did not actually stop drinking and cannot even be honest about it . all this adding on to my issues ive already had with anxiety and depression , i am really not sure how much longer i can survive for . leaving my cats was one of the things that kept me from ending my life , but now that they are gone i honestly struggle to find a reason to keep going . i appreciate you if you spent the time to listen to me talk . i try to keep venting in hopes one time it will actually help , but so far nothing . i am just running out of options .

"light flows our war of mocking words , and yet , behold , with tears mine eyes are wet ! i feel a nameless sadness o'er me roll . yes , yes , we know that we can jest , we know , we know that we can smile ! but there is a something in this breast , to which thy light words bring no rest , and thy gay smiles no anodyne . give me thy hand , and hush awhile , and turn those limpid eyes on mine , and let me read there , love ! thy inmost soul . alas ! is even love too weak to unlock the heart , and let it speak ? are even lovers powerless to reveal to one another what indeed they feel ? i knew the mass of men conceal'd their thoughts , for fear that if reveal'd they would by other men be met with blank indifference , or with blame reproved ; i knew they lived and moved trick'd in disguises , alien to the rest of men , and alien to themselves — and yet the same heart beats in every human breast ! but we , my love ! — doth a like spell benumb our hearts , our voices ? — must we too be dumb ? ah ! well for us , if even we , even for a moment , can get free our heart , and have our lips unchain'd ; for that which seals them hath been deep - ordain'd ! fate , which foresaw how frivolous a baby man would be — by what distractions he would be possess'd , how he would pour himself in every strife , and well - nigh change his own identity — that it might keep from his capricious play his genuine self , and force him to obey even in his own despite his being's law , bade through the deep recesses of our breast the unregarded river of our life pursue with indiscernible flow its way ; and that we should not see the buried stream , and seem to be eddying at large in blind uncertainty , though driving on with it eternally . but often , in the world's most crowded streets , but often , in the din of strife , there rises an unspeakable desire after the knowledge of our buried life ; a thirst to spend our fire and restless force in tracking out our true , original course ; a longing to inquire into the mystery of this heart which beats so wild , so deep in us — to know whence our lives come and where they go . and many a man in his own breast then delves , but deep enough , alas ! none ever mines . and we have been on many thousand lines , and we have shown , on each , spirit and power ; but hardly have we , for one little hour , been on our own line , have we been ourselves — hardly had skill to utter one of all the nameless feelings that course through our breast , but they course on for ever unexpress'd . and long we try in vain to speak and act our hidden self , and what we say and do is eloquent , is well — but 't is not true ! and then we will no more be rack'd with inward striving , and demand of all the thousand nothings of the hour their stupefying power ; ah yes , and they benumb us at our call ! yet still , from time to time , vague and forlorn , from the soul's subterranean depth upborne as from an infinitely distant land , come airs , and floating echoes , and convey a melancholy into all our day . only — but this is rare — when a belovèd hand is laid in ours , when , jaded with the rush and glare of the interminable hours , our eyes can in another's eyes read clear , when our world - deafen'd ear is by the tones of a loved voice caress'd — a bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast , and a lost pulse of feeling stirs again . the eye sinks inward , and the heart lies plain , and what we mean , we say , and what we would , we know . a man becomes aware of his life's flow , and hears its winding murmur ; and he sees the meadows where it glides , the sun , the breeze . and there arrives a lull in the hot race wherein he doth for ever chase that flying and elusive shadow , rest . an air of coolness plays upon his face , and an unwonted calm pervades his breast . and then he thinks he knows the hills where his life rose , and the sea where it goes .

"we sat together at one summer’s end , that beautiful mild woman , your close friend , and you and i , and talked of poetry . i said , ‘a line will take us hours maybe ; yet if it does not seem a moment’s thought , our stitching and unstitching has been naught . better go down upon your marrow - bones and scrub a kitchen pavement , or break stones like an old pauper , in all kinds of weather ; for to articulate sweet sounds together is to work harder than all these , and yet be thought an idler by the noisy set of bankers , schoolmasters , and clergymen the martyrs call the world . ’ and thereupon that beautiful mild woman for whose sake there’s many a one shall find out all heartache on finding that her voice is sweet and low replied , ‘to be born woman is to know — although they do not talk of it at school — that we must labour to be beautiful . ’ i said , ‘it’s certain there is no fine thing since adam’s fall but needs much labouring . there have been lovers who thought love should be so much compounded of high courtesy that they would sigh and quote with learned looks precedents out of beautiful old books ; yet now it seems an idle trade enough . ’ we sat grown quiet at the name of love ; we saw the last embers of daylight die , and in the trembling blue - green of the sky a moon , worn as if it had been a shell washed by time’s waters as they rose and fell about the stars and broke in days and years . i had a thought for no one’s but your ears : that you were beautiful , and that i strove to love you in the old high way of love ; that it had all seemed happy , and yet we’d grown as weary - hearted as that hollow moon .

"the three men now stood satisfied , arms crossed , joking among themselves , but only moments before they hadn’t been laughing . it had taken all three to bind the struggling man . first , to limit his movement , they had duct - taped his wrists together behind his back : for that , one man had held his legs and another had pinned him , one hand on each shoulderblade and one knee on his head , at his left temple , grinding his right cheek and eye into the dust and straw and dried shit that formed the floor of the barn . first they bound his wrists , then his ankles . then it got easier . more tape over his mouth , wound all the way around his head , three full loops , much more than was necessary , which was one thing they were laughing about , the two bigger men making fun of the smaller one , who had done that part of the binding . then they’d bound him down on the mattress , again with the tape . the bound man continued to struggle , but once the tape denied him movement he felt as if he were thinking clearly , as if his panic had lifted , resistance become mere obligation . he thought surely the tape would run out , but they had another roll , just in case . he noticed the new order — head first this round — when it came to the mattress . one man would lift one end just off the dirt , enough for another to wrap the tape , which cursed coming off the roll in what the man construed as sympathy , all the way around the mattress in loops that included his head and neck , then the same process at the other end , all the way around the mattress and his ankles . they couldn’t figure how to get the tape around his torso because it was so near the middle of the mattress . the bound man found himself wanting to help , but of course he couldn’t speak , and anyway they didn’t need his advice . his hands bound behind his back and against the mattress meant his feet and head , and most of all his neck , were plenty to keep him from getting loose and grabbing one of their guns . the bound man’s life didn’t pass before him in summary , exactly , but he did see things now that in all these years he hadn’t noticed . the wiring , for instance . he thought it must have been his own father who’d wired the barn with that odd blend of pride and makeshift half - competence that showed up in all his father’d made , himself not least . one bare bulb bragging from the highest joist about its white porcelain fixture , but better , really , at casting long shadows than at lighting the place , though if the three men would just leave him alone , he thought , he’d be able to count up all the birds’ nests and speculate on where swallows had built before there were barns . the wire ran from switchbox to fixture in straight lines and right angles , through half - inch galvanized surely intended for plumbing but good , too , for frustrating the rats . it was the short man , the one who’d done all the taping , who then poured kerosene across the mattress and over the man , soaking his clothes , making sure to splash some into his eyes . no one else noticed , but he spelled out fuck with the kerosene . or anyway swung his arms in that pattern . that was when they could relax a little , the three men , and start their joking , once the kerosene was poured . one tall man slapped his forehead : “ you brought matches , right ? ” “ matches ? ” the other replied , furrowing his brow and patting his pockets , and both laughed out loud . even the short man smiled . barns burn , it turns out , just the way you’d think if you thought about it , hay fast and hot , siding lighting the roof and the flooring of the loft , all the slender strips of wood , with the few parts not tinder — the frame , the beams and joists — starting last and lasting longest . but that’s not what the mattress - bound man’s great - great - grandfather had thought about , its someday burning , as he built the barn . he had a daughter to worry about , and a wife big with what he thought might be a boy . and weather , and a dozen cows . plenty to fret more immediate than which fuck - up would later taint his bloodline and preside over the decay , finally inviting the sacrifice , of what he had built to last . barns burn like bonfires built for the burning , stacked just so by one mortal for the next . they burn best at night , whether or not communicants travel up and down billows lit silver from above , red from below . and whether or not three men have stopped among sycamores on the rise just opposite and turned for a moment to admire their handiwork .

"long story short tw : rape i've had suicide ideation since 2013 , i was raped in 2012 , and the court case ( uk ) lasted until october 2015 . he admitted it on interview but pleaded not guilty . his defence managed to convince the jury that ( quote from judge ) whilst there is no question a rape took place , was he aware of his actions . he walked . i made several attempts from them ending in hospital two or three times , that stopped when i fell in love with an old friend . november 2016 , i went to hungary to celebrate my birthday . i went outside for a cigarette at the bar , got pushed into a fake cab , taken to a campsite and raped , and pushed out on the motorway . i found my way back to the hotel where my partner was ( same guy as above ) . may 2017 , my best friend was killed in a motorbike crash . that coupled with the recent attack , my relationship suffered . in february 2018 , i split up with my ex but we still lived together . in november 2018 , i hung myself . i saw bright colours , felt euphoria , accepted it . fucking woke up sick on the floor did not i because it did not hold my weight . after that i felt like it was a sign , like i could go through with it if i wanted to but i had a choice not to . fast forward til now , my ex moved out in january 2020 , i understand it was too long to live together . but we started sleeping together again since may 2019 and have continued to , to august 2020 . i've told him i love him a bunch of times , but he does not seem to feel the same way . i cannot fucking cope trapped in this mindset ; coupled with the fact that since january 2019 i have been diagnosed with me / cfs . i'm a shell of a human being , and my chronic illnesses will not get better . i am fed up of my past , and my subsequent diagnosed c - ptsd , the fact that every day is fucking painful , and the love of my life fucks me when it suits him and ignores me when it doesn't . i went for about a year without ideations but recently they are back and they are strong . i keep thinking about how my family and my cats will be okay if i am gone , and i am testing coat hooks on the back of my doors in my home again . i do not trust myself not to impulsively decide i have had enough again but this time my weight would hold . it is intrusive to the point i think about it constantly again i'm so fucked",1,,,257

"for a month now , wandering over the sierras , a poem had been gathering in my mind , details of significance and rhythm , the way poems do , but still lacking a focus . last night i remembered the date and it all began to grow together and take on purpose . we sat up late while deneb moved over the zenith and i told marie all about boston , how it looked that last terrible week , how hundreds stood weeping impotent in the streets that last midnight . i told her how those hours changed the lives of thousands , how america was forever a different place afterwards for many . in the morning we swam in the cold transparent lake , the blue damsel flies on all the reeds like millions of narrow metallic flowers , and i thought of you behind the grille in dedham , vanzetti , saying , “ who would ever have thought we would make this history ? ” crossing the brilliant mile - square meadow illuminated with asters and cyclamen , the pollen of the lodgepole pines drifting with the shifting wind over it and the blue and sulphur butterflies drifting with the wind , i saw you in the sour prison light , saying , “ goodbye comrade . ” in the basin under the crest where the pines end and the sierra primrose begins , a party of lawyers was shooting at a whiskey bottle . the bottle stayed on its rock , nobody could hit it . looking back over the peaks and canyons from the last lake , the pattern of human beings seemed simpler than the diagonals of water and stone . climbing the chute , up the melting snow and broken rock , i remembered what you said about sacco , how it slipped your mind and you demanded it be read into the record . traversing below the ragged arête , one cheek pressed against the rock the wind slapping the other , i saw you both marching in an army you with the red and black flag , sacco with the rattlesnake banner . i kicked steps up the last snow bank and came to the indescribably blue and fragrant polemonium and the dead sky and the sterile crystalline granite and final monolith of the summit . these are the things that will last a long time , vanzetti , i am glad that once on your day i have stood among them . some day mountains will be named after you and sacco . they will be here and your name with them , “ when these days are but a dim remembering of the time when man was wolf to man . ” i think men will be remembering you a long time standing on the mountains many men , a long time , comrade .

( i know it sounds crazy but , i was naive and believed it . ) we became closer and started working on projects outside of my internship . i helped him produce a podcast , film a web series , write countless scripts to pitch to netflix and finally , i helped him from start to finish film a horror film . every project we ever worked on was “ his ” not mine . i had zero value because i was merely learning from his exalted greatness . the only problem was , none of his projects were ever successful and i was never paid for any of my efforts . he found me when i was in college and now three years out of college i have nothing to show for all of the work i’ve done . aside from infiltrating my life professionally , he also invaded my personal relationships . i was told that my friends were too immature and in order to be successful i had to be willing to drop everyone including my family . . . so i did . i wanted so badly to move to la and to be working on entertainment that i was willing to follow my “ mentor ” and leave everyone behind to do it . by isolating myself the only person left to depend on was him . i ran out of money and moved in with him and his brother . while living at the brother’s house his parents moved in so , i was living in a house where i was the only person that wasn’t blood related . before moving in , i made sure it was ok for me to bring my two cats . everyone seemed fine so , i brought my babies . during my time living there , it became clear that the parents were not ok with my cats and only prioritized their dog’s needs . one day , they left the doggy door open and one of my cats escaped . i have zero friends , no job , no hopes of getting a professional job with the world in its current state and absolutely worst of all , my cat is missing because my roommates let him out . it’s been two months and i’m losing hope . things can be replaced and money comes and goes but , i didn’t protect the little innocent being that relied on me and now my cat is gone . i hate myself . i hate people . they can’t be trusted and no one actually cares about you ; all they want is to get something out of you . i don’t trust men ( lots of abandonment and daddy issues ) i want a family but i don’t ever see that happening . i am not willing to get close enough for anyone to hurt me . i just can’t take it anymore and want to die .

"for all those who read this i am a 15 year old boy going into grade 11 and previous to this story i was diagnosed with depression , anxiety , and severe suicidal tendencies for the last year i was in an abusive relationship with a girl , she was incredibly manipulative and we fought almost everyday even with my extensive efforts to stop it with me just apologizing just to end it . about 3 - 4 months ago i learned she cheated on me which beat me down so far , i did not get out of bed , i was extremely numb and thought about suicide everyday at least twice but after two weeks i forgave her cause i felt like she was the only girl i would ever have . the best part was she guilt tripped me into letting her stay "" friends "" with the guy she cheated on me with . a month later she asked me to do her streaks and i am the type to understand privacy and always told her that i value privacy after a traumatic experience when i was 10 . but i digress , and i did her streaks and i accidentally clicked on the top guy and went into their chat accidentally . . i see her nudes sent to this guy and saying she would date him etc . i was furious but after hours and hours of arguing i was burnt out and ready to end it all . she said he stole her phone and sent those to himself and those texts of dating him was from her friend who took her phone . i believed her and i apologized for getting angry and i do not remember her apologizing for that either . now by this time it was coming up to be our six month anniversary and i wanted to do something special so i did some research , she came from mexico and she loved the day of the dead , so i thought i would i would grow her a pot of marigolds a flower known for the day of the dead and daises because it was one of her favorite flowers . by this time i have growing these flowers for easily 2 - 3 months and they were doing great , i felt this was a lot of effort and a great gift . i told her the gift early because i was to excited to keep it a secret and wanted to tell her , i did and one of the most painful things i heard this day , she said "" that's it ? "" . . "" could you get me something more ? "" . . i was furious , i lashed out and i was tired of being second place to her , i was so god damn mad after all the work and effort to keep these flowers alive ( which was not easy ) . i broke up with her on the spot over the phone . my family really disliked this girl , they all saw how manipulative and cruel at times she was . i felt free at the time . i was happy as my family said this was the right decision and i was starting to see the mind games more clearly . a month later she got her friend to tell me to give her things back and by this time i thought i was over her . her friend said "" you do not have to worry she has a new boyfriend "" . i have no idea why but this hurt so badly and i was extremely sad , i got chills for hours . anyways i texted her , i was shaking violently , i was scared and extremely anxious and i was sweating , i have no idea why i was feeling this way but we got it sorted and i told her i have to go and i cannot keep her added for my own safety . now as the time of writing i am extremely suicidal and depressed , i cannot get out bed , i cannot move . i feel completely alone and i feel everything bad i caused and i had it coming . i am ready to leave this planet , i want it all to end . i would tell my family and friends but i do not want them to worry and freak out and rush me to the hospital . i feel useless and worthless , i just want to go painlessly and calmly . i do not what i am feeling is real but it is gotten to the point of every time i pass or see anything dangerous it is almost like my brain logs it and thinks "" could this kill me quickly ? "" . i feel crazy and i feel everyone is always mad at me . i just want my life to end so badly . . . ",1,,,4483

"as i read the several posts you all have posted on here , i’m gravely discouraged how my prediction that suicidal thoughts would increase especially during this time . i am human , just like you , and i don’t come pretending like i have answers , but i can tell you i’ve survived several suicide attempts and several losses of life of most of the most important people in my life . . . including my boyfriend of 4 years and a parent . here are somethings that have helped along the way . it doesn’t over night . . . but the more you try the better your chances are at not only surviving but perhaps looking forward to life . i’ve been raped by someone i loved , i’ve been beaten since a young age , i’ve been manipulated , used , shamed , and shot myself in the foot . the list does go on . 1 . people will disappoint you obviously , but there are some people out there maybe you haven’t met yet who genuinely care about you and your well - being . those who have disappointed you , whom you desperately want approval from hurt you . that’s normal to feel hurt . but you weren’t born into your life for someone else . if someone special in your life is worth the sacrifice , then carefully examine the relationship . if you’re hurting , and someone uses an automated hollow response that seems to put a lid on your expression of feelings , sometimes it not ill intent , and sometimes depending on a cold response someone has , they aren’t worth your time . it’s so easy to lose faith in humanity . but diamonds do exist in the rough . keep looking . 2 . it’s all too familiar to feel so stuck in our little prisons of life , routine , bad habits , bad relationships , just lifestyles that does not hold promise for your peace , happiness and truth . the hardest part is getting started but once you have traction going , it gets easier . . . we have to give ourselves chances to break out of the simulation . you deserve boundaries no matter your age . why do other people have boundaries but then there are those who feel they don’t deserve it ? because you’re probably too kind to see that even though your heart is huge , you can’t put it on your sleeve . it’s one thing to show respect to people , but true respect is earned . you deserve that . 3 . trying something new can be frightening or seem like “ that sounds lame ” . . . . but it can be just what you need . if you are anxious easily , it’s normal ; yet you must take a leap of faith without impulse . have you made a kite before ? look up the steps , give it a try , take your time . have you looked up some nice hiking areas ? trying art even if you feel like “ you suck ” ? even if you feel you fail , you gain . 4 . we are all going to die eventually , why not play the game until time runs out ? pain is a great defense . i understand pain , almost like torture . . . . but there are ways to escape it . there are things to look forward to . even if they are small . learning the value of the uniqueness of something meaningful to you , and taking time to think about the things you do have that are blessings are easy to take for granted , but it’s a gift . we aren’t promised anything in life except one day it will end , but i’m sure you can think of at least three things that have been good in your life . it may seem like everything blows right now , but it’s not forever . 5 . patience is key . i’ve spent years feeling like i was spiraling into death . patience is only going to make you stronger which will lead to further success in life . 6 . perspective can be shifted , and cognitive healing techniques and how you react is extraordinarily helpful . 7 . there’s so many types of meditation , even though it seems pointless many times . 8 . eating a nourishing meal , or trying new cuisine to cook helps , even with a budget . make it an occasion even if it’s for yourself to have dinner . no matter your weight , you deserve to nourish your body . salmon has been proven to significantly increase chemicals in the brain that sparks optimism and productivity . 9 . seeing a therapist or calling the suicide hotline can seem like you’re talking to a robot filled with cliches that are tired like . . . ” true love starts with you . . . ” or “ there will be light at the end of the tunnel ” which is almost insulting . perspective starts with you . . . . and learning what to add and subtract from you life as time goes on helps step by step . not everyone will seem to get in tuned with what you experience , keep the faith . someone may say something you can relate to so well that it will bring clarity in some form or another . hang onto those moments . 10 . we are never truly alone as lonely as many of you feel . it’s a horrible feeling when you don’t have someone to tell you how much they admire you , no one who’s holding you tight , but if more people knew you i’m sure many can see the beauty you have and your potential . there is always someone out there willing to be there for you , maybe you need to take the time alone to heal and restore yourself a bit after a good long rest . that’s some of what i had to say . i really hope many of you find faith in yourselves and what life could be . you deserve it ! i’m here if you want to vent to someone . you’re not “ weird ” or “ weak ” because you have emotions like a normal human being . man or woman .

" ( obligatory : english is not my first language , i am french , and i am typing this on my phone so i will do my best ) i have fibromyalgia . if you do not know what that is , then you are lucky . it is not the same for everyone , but for me , it is constant body pain . and by constant , i mean all the time , even with painkillers , i am always in pain , my arms , my shoulders my back , my knees , my feet . . . but i also have rheumatism , chronic severe depression , bipolarity and a sh ! tload of other gleeful stuff . so basically ; i am in pain all the time , i take exactly 13 medications per day , i feel like shit one minute then feel like a queen the next , i cannot walk without a cane and i need a wheelchair in winter because of the humidity making me rusty and sore . i've failed a serious relationship before because of this . i cannot blame that person , i was a f * cking train wreck . we were young ( 18 , 19 yo ) so i really do not blame them because they deserved better . then , my best friend of 10 years confessed that he loved me . i warned him i could be unstable even with the medication , and he said he did not care . they all say that . he is in the prime of his life , he is 26 and at peak at his job , i am 24 and i am just a 96 years old lass trapped in a body that looks fine . today marks out first year and a half as a couple , and i have noticed him growing more and more out of me . we argue , he always finds something that is wrong , and he finally began blaming my illness . i feel like he is going to break up with me very soon . very soon . ( right now he decided to go sleep in our guest room because i told him it was okay if he needed to go to bed and sleep but i was just disappointed because he promised we would watch a movie before bed . that is it , i just said i was disappointed , told him i loved him , but he still went to the guest room . so i have been thinking about something for a while now , and finally decided it was going to happen . this man gave me the best times of my life . i have never felt so alive when i am with him , and i know that if our relationships ends , i am just going back being the handicapped lass strapped to a wheelchair , depending on everyone , being a f * cking parasite , feeling pain and misery all the time . so if he breaks up with me , i am going to write a letter to the few peoples who loves me . my mum , my sister , my best friend and maybe my dad . then i am hopping on a random train , post these letters , find a place to hide , and kill myself . i just cannot go back to being that handicapped , miserable lass i was , depending on my financially poor mother , or my sick 67 years old dad . i just cannot do it anymore . so when the time comes , i will die in a peaceful way , i have planned everything , and i will make sure my family will never have to see my corpse . if you read that far , thank you , and sorry .

"i really wish i could . i want the sadness and pain to end . i cannot afford therapy anymore since my insurance lapsed and i no longer have a bank account , on top of other shit i just feel like my life is never going to go anywhere but down . i have felt this way for 7 years . every glimmer of hope or any piece of happiness i manage to get fizzles out or gets ripped away from me and i end up back where i started . it happens without fail . i am just in a bottomless pit of despair and i am so sick of living like this . the nightmares . i cannot think about ending it without having nightmares . at first it was just a little pang of guilt , thinking of my family and friends and how sad they would be . now it is seeing them finding me cold and lifeless . i can hear their screams and it fucking haunts me . i could not do that to them . i desperately wish i could push all of that aside and just end it but i can't . i really feel like i am not supposed to be here . sometimes i do not even feel human . i feel like this life just is not for me . i truly believe it will just end in tragedy . i will probably be dead by 30 . i am just a failure at everything , most importantly life . i do not want to wait for that day to come . i wish i could have it now . no one understands . i am all alone . i will be stuck this way no matter what , so what is the point ? i hurt people , people hurt me , i hurt myself . it is a vicious cycle . but even if i break it , everyone still ends up hurt . i still hurt people . i do not wanna be the monster i feel like i am . i just want to be happy . i just want my family to be proud of me again . my whole life i have lived for everyone else except for myself . the one thing i want to do for myself , i can't . i just want to be okay . but i can't .

"i'm lost & i give up . . i recently turned 18 so i am now legally an adult but i never had the chance to live a normal childhood , being chronically ill from the start i lived my starting years up until i was 4 inside the hospital without my parents company for the majority . i cannot remember much of my childhood being delightful as i was never taught the basics things like social skills or the basic understandings of emotion & empathy . and as i got older i struggled with extreme social anxiety , aviodent personality disorder , self harm as well as anorexia and i am still struggling on with it all now . i have begged time and time again to get help for this and each time i have been shot down . i am now on my final year of college still without a single friend or clue to the world . i am tired of spending my days constantly isolated left to my own devices , i do not want to live this miserable life i have got nothing to my name , nothing to lose .

"it really does not get any better , we just care less about the bad not suicidal ( although thats another option now that i have brought it up ) from unaware but super sad teenager who did not know how badly his life was already fucked up , to 21 year old who has so many issues that he appears as completely fine to therapists because he cannot even identify the problems , he only knows theyre there because of how he feels but funnily enough he cannot express how it feels because he spent most of his life either alone or bullied ( at one stage he * was * the bully ) and never had healthy relationships with his parents - who knows maybe even all of this is being expressed incorrectly too ? ! ? fuck i hate people , i hate the nature of language i hate the systems we have built i hate the people in my family especially , how selfish can you be to let all three of your own kids go homeless ? how could you even defend that ? how does my mum even have a relationship ? i hate all my friends who left my side when i opened up about a mutual friend that was harrassing / tormenting me . i hate that person for still having our friends in his life despite how undeserving that gluttonous pig is . i want to beat that pussies head in with a golf club now that i know how naive / vulnerable i was and how sick and twisted he is . i hate how thats the narrative i have of the situation but its probably not objectively accurate . i hate how i am probably a narcissist - i started feeling a little insecure , triggered by the fact that my stepdad has not been homw this weekend which is unusual so i started wondering if it was something to do with me . ( recently moved in because id probably be homeless if i did not - even then he still guilt trips me about not paying commercial rates ) so i ended up on reddit to create this narritive about how i am such a victim so please give me your sympathy waaaaah : ' ( ( ( i hate how even though i am mocking that narrative , its still what i believe and it does not change the fact that i still have no hope for my future . never held a job . never held a friendship . never been in a relationship . never had a hobby that wasnt simultaneously an addiction . never had any kind of healthy relationship with anybody other than the strangers every now and again that try to talk when out and about in town ? i hate how i am in constant survival mode so i am never present or mindful enough to actually properly reciprocate those conversations . theres so much pressure on me cus i have no skills and so many mental health problems , but i do not have anyone to depend on to let life stop for long enough so that i can take a breather and recover from the past by maybe fixing my sleeping pattern , getting a routine , learning how to be comfortable with people , and eventually stop faking emotions and attitudes cus id actually have the skills to interpret my real ones . but is that even possible * for me * to achieve any of that ? its been about 4 years jumping between government benefits and jobs , all the while ive been strenuoulsy trying to make improvements . ive been on sleeping pills during that period , and still , my sleeping pattern is fucked . i am 21 and already shpwing signs of aging , , the right side of my face is starting to droop from stress . i used to be handsome as fuck and now on top of all of that i have my looks to worry about ? i wish i did not care but i cannot believe how much i took for granted ; i had hope for a little while because i did not expect that life could get any worse i had to see my old friends a couple weeks back because one of the ones i * actually * liked , because he * actually * was somewhat decent ( although also turned his back on me ) killed himself now i am seriously contemplating selling my car and all my belongings to buy a bike and run ( i really mean bike ) away from everything and everyone and live in the city on the streets . at least then id have the time to focus on improving the little things , one thing at a time thiss is all so fucked because i had and still have so so so so sooo much potential to do well . from day one of school i had great grades , i was intellectual , funny , athletic , innovative , but my decision making and emotional stability is so fucked from having it rough that i do not stand a chance when it comes to actually inplementing any of these things in the real world . survival is a conpetition , and i am too far behind because i did not get the beginner lessons . i cannot connect to people anymore , its almost psychopathic some of the responses to things i have now adays rant over , this shit is the worst its like a huge fuckking doggy pile where the people at the top are the survivors and u gotta kick people down and use them as support in order to get there . i just feel so used and oppressed and unheard and even getting this out there does not satisfy the hunger i am feeling . ive gotten so used to it though that i do not get emotional about it anymore hence why i am actually considering / preparing for homelessness instead of killing myself it can * only * get worse as jordan peterson says , the first 4 years of your life determines the rest of it . we just find it "" inspiring "" and "" meaningful "" to spend the rest of our lives fighting",1,,,3551

"i had such a terrible childhood . parents died young . dad abused me . it took so much from me . i made so many mistakes because of that and i really hate how much i have wasted my life due to recovering from trauma . not having loving parents to support you . i always felt so alone in the world . at 28 i am finally over it , but i made a huge mistake in the process : i ruined my health by smoking way too much weed and cigs on a poor diet . think i will die young . i had an ex who was 8 years older . she was like a second mom to me . but . . . in hindsight i think she was a kind of manipulative person . she invested a ton of love into me , bought gifts , made me feel so loved , when i told her about my parents she suddenly had this very fake cry and now i think she must have thought 'i can use this to get this guy to never leave me' , she also started a relationship with me after one evening together and went into it head first , never gave me a chance to back out . but . . . when it was time to 'pay up' , i did not deliver . i realised i was not the one for her and ended things . after that she went from sweet to cold . she gave me one last chance to meet up last summer ( 2019 ) , but after i did not do that she gave up on me . i am dumb and did not understand that she really hates me now . about one year later i was feeling extremely down and suicidal and because i do not have a great support system , she felt like someone i needed to talk to . she said something about how she had improved a lot . i impulsively replied with 'fuck improving' and talked about how i am so done , it was just my mood of that day because i have actually improved a lot too , but she was like 'get a life' and blocked me . i then felt like i had to explain myself and made a new account . it takes like 3 seconds on instagram . it is something i did without thinking of the consequences . i was trying so hard to get her sympathy and make me understand me , i was being very vulnerable and admitting how i fucked up everything , but she did not have any compassion , called it whining and kept engaging with long messages and then blocking me . she would also tell me to stop contacting , but i wanted to reply to all the things she wrote and i did not want her to leave forever so i naively kept going . the dumbest thing i did is when she said 'you did not change a bit and only went backwards' and i started arguing about that because i have changed a lot , went from an extremely unhealthy guy to someone who works out 12 hours per week and eats the best food , gained 20kg , graduated , works 50 hours per week and so on . in the end she exploded with the harshest message possible . for example she wrote 'you'll never learn how to live your life' and called me a loser , a tragic whiner and said she did not care if i died . she also told me she would never reply again . that made me feel even more suicidal . it made me feel like 'you're a loser , you will always stay a loser , you will never amount to anything , you are so far below me , such an inferior piece of shit and you should just get rid of your miserable existence' . i kept messaging her for months begging to talk it out and to explain myself , but she never replied and that only made me feel even more pathetic . so now i am completely ruined and feel like such a mess of a person . . . i really struggle to make a comeback from this .

"hello : ) for this week i have decided to explain how i deal with my childhood fears . i hope i am going to help someone with a similar problem ; ) & # x200b ; probably most of you will find this article useless or incomprehensible . i am aware of this . i will be describing a thing that i do not think is happening to most of us . but i think people who experienced something bad in their childhood . any harassment of violence or other signs of abuse will understand me perfectly . let me first explain the term ‘bad childhood' in my example . i think it will help to provide some clarity to my message somehow to all the readers . # bad childhood i have already mentioned several times in my articles about the situations that have had the greatest impact on me in my life . namely , it is about this situation when i was undressed in my childhood by my friends from the yard and laughed at . from an adult perspective , this problem does not seem that big . i think so . each of us in adulthood has this level of eroticism to some extent developed that we are not so ashamed of ourselves when we are naked . it is worse if we experience it in childhood when we are in this stage of adolescence . however , i will not elaborate on what a shock it is and make a poor man of myself , because that is not what this is about . it is just the fact that it happened to me . and it is sitting in my head like a fly on shit . because i was always lonely in my childhood . i tried to treat the friends i had on my way as best as possible - in my opinion . however , it was in junior high school that my only friend then said the words to me that i remember to this day . namely , he said that if i did not stop crying so much , he would stop talking to me . these words had a great influence on me . after that , we talked less and less , because i totally could not get on with myself . until we finally broke off contact . you know what i’m talking about . for a person who is fairly normal there for this age ; it has some friends . i have never had one before . that is why this situation hurt me so much and i remember it to this day . and why i did not have anyone was partly due to the first situation , whereafter it happened i stopped appearing in the yard at all . i became totally alienated from people because i did not get any support from them . and when they were there , they usually hurt me . so my self - esteem was zero . i only emphasize that i was always alone with all this . nobody supported me , and i was ashamed to tell my parents about it because they had their own problems . it was related to alcohol or lack of money . # the true definition of fear fear is defined as "" an unpleasant , often strong emotion triggered by the expectation or awareness of danger "" . this emotion lives in all living things . it is part of what makes us human , but it is a clever , rather unfortunate adaptation . the main purpose of fear is to keep us alive and safe in the face of imminent danger . we have managed to develop a fear of a distant danger that exists only in our minds and may not happen at all . of course , the fear of imminent danger once proved to be an effective evolutionary trait without which we probably would not be where we are . however , the fear of distant danger is then stupid and unfounded . it seems to me that if you are reading this , for example , an attack of a cheetah or a puma does not threaten you . just a similar fear appears in my head when my bad childhood memories come back . for some time they paralyzed me , and when i had a goal , i immediately did not feel like doing anything . the goals that i set for myself receded into the background , and in their place , bad memories appeared . for a person whose childhood and adolescence was fairly normal . i can compare it to the situation when you remember the situation from your childhood . only they are probably not related to some trauma . and more with games in the yard . you know what i am saying . # meditation i was not able to deal with my childhood fears at all until i started meditating . i discovered the meditation completely by accident when i came across information about her in one of the youtube videos from rob gryn - known in poland as the youngest polish millionaire . he had similar problems to mine . so i thought i would give it a try . what can i lose trying ? at worst , i will assume i have tried and it is not for me . it was about a year ago . and i meditate until today . without it , i felt such a sense of hopelessness and misunderstanding . because i did not know people who went through something similar to me . it is also not an easy topic to talk about . well , everything turned out fine in the end . the will to commit suicide disappeared and the moments of total doubt where i had no strength for anything . as if by further exploring the meditation , i just came to terms with my past . not entirely , but so much that it does not reach the extreme states i mentioned earlier . of course , i meditate daily so as not to lose this skill , but when there is a period of bad thoughts , the frequency of meditation also changes . i do it during this period , in fact , whenever i detect a bad thought in my head "" oh , now there is a bad thought - it is time to meditate and i am doing it . "" in the current situation , meditation is something i will probably have to practice for the rest of my days . # write down your memories an equally effective method that supported me when i took my first steps in meditation and did not know how to use it fully is simply writing down memories . here it does not matter whether we do it on a piece of paper , on the phone or on the computer . it is important here to write down these memories . reading them later will allow you to adapt with them . after some time writing them down 3 , 4 and then the n - th time , they will become something normal for you . you can ask "" but why should i write it down ? "" . i have already listed one of the goals , but the other more important is to avoid what i call "" thought clutter "" . as a rule , these bad memories paralyze us , making it completely impossible to function . at least i did . but it was this writing that gave some signal . i do not know what to call it . to my brain , that i already take care of it . it seems simple , but i really recommend trying it . # why does not sport help in the long run ? it may seem that sport will be perfect here . anyone who has run or exercised in any other way knows that when we are physically active our thoughts seem to run away . we do not even have the strength to think about anything other than rest and balancing our breathing after training . this is what it is all about . it is only a short - term relief , which in the long run does not contribute to the improvement of our mental state . and that is not what we mean . there is a very wise saying that sums it up perfectly in my opinion "" keep your friends close and your enemies closer "" . this phrase perfectly describes the crux of the problem . running away from bad memories will only make your situation worse . it was only meditation and writing notes that allowed me to become friends with this pain to such an extent that now i am starting to talk about it , which a few months ago would have been unthinkable for me . i think that the topic of how to use this fear for myself will be described in one of the next articles . because it is also an amazing strength . people with such memories are motivated by fear in their lives . they do not want to experience these bad moments anymore . therefore , with a little luck , they manage to achieve spectacular success . it does not have to be some business , of course , but it can push you to live closer to your interests or around what you once missed . family or friends . & # x200b ; link to original article : [ https : / / www . pawelwojtasinski . blog / article / 52 ] ( https : / / www . pawelwojtasinski . blog / article / 52 ) ",1,,,2174

"was it pascal who said “ almost all our misery has come from not being able to remain alone in our rooms ” ? baudelaire thought it might have been , but was not sure . and let’s take a look at that “ almost ” which i’m very glad is there . i can think of lots of misery that had nothing to do with my not having been alone in my room . when i get a rejection email on a train for a piece of work i had high hopes for is one example . or to go way back , when i returned home to find my white mouse dead when i was eleven or twelve . or to take a mundane example , when a plane i’m booked on is twelve hours delayed , while i hang about the airport . i have never had a huge problem with solitude , it is true . as a child i read voraciously , and would find some hidden corner to lurk with my book . the game of golf is one where one can enjoy being alone , especially very early on a beautiful morning . the time when i most felt alone was when the missionaries came to my school and we all had to endure a silent retreat for three days . at the end of that time i felt like one of those astronauts in films who have to stay on the moon for months . baudelaire claimed his friend the devil loved bleak , solitary places where the spirit of murder and lust was more likely to ignite . he decided that this was not really a danger for most of us , though , only for those idle , fanciful folk prone to enigmas and dreaming . the type of person who should most avoid being alone is a chatterbox or maybe a television pundit . but what’s to stop these people being verbose in their own company ? did crusoe , for example , stay quiet on his island before friday came ? according to elizabeth bishop in her great poem , “ crusoe in england , ” he did not . and in order to write that poem , ms . bishop needed to be alone . this did not stop her from cooking meals and inviting friends to help her eat the food and drink wine with her . after this , probably the next morning , she went back to the poem and her solitude . i feel the french maybe exaggerate the benefits of being alone . that philosopher and writer jean - paul sartre for example , his play huis - clos with its famous line “ l’enfer , c’est les autres . ” yes , we all know how annoying other people often are , and how strong the urge to escape from them can be . but the two characters vladimir and estragon in beckett’s waiting for godot show that even in an absurdist setting companionship has its importance . it’s said beckett got his inspiration for this play from one or other of two versions of caspar david friedrich’s painting two men contemplating the moon which he saw on a trip to germany in 1936 or ’37 . in both versions of the painting one of the men has his hand on the other man’s shoulder , a sign of companionship if ever there was one . baudelaire quotes the french philosopher and moralist jean de la bruyère ( or delabruyère , as the man signed himself ) , “ what a great misfortune we cannot be alone , ” as if to chastise anyone who wants to plunge into a crowd or go into a busy bar . what about the great french word fraternité , the third of the three words that were the rallying cry of the revolution ? i want to close this by giving another quote from de la bruyère : “ out of difficulties grow miracles . ” i prefer this one . anyone in an awkward social situation should dwell on that .

"that was a great compliment the greeks paid to human life when they imagined their gods living as humans do , with the same pleasure in love and feasting , headstrong as we are , turbulent , quick to anger , slow to forgive . just like us , only immortal . and now that those gods have proven mortal too and heaven and earth can’t be divided , every death means a divine occasion has been taken from us , a divine perspective , though the loss gets only a line or two in the news . hard to believe the headlines this morning that a banker on mt . olympus has been pilfering , that a builder has been guilty of shoddy construction on a bridge that spans a river in heaven , cutting corners to squirrel away his fortune for a better day , when the great day has already come . for news that heartens we must turn to the classifieds . here in what’s left of heaven it’s right to advertise for a soul mate . it’s right to look for a job that lets us incarnate spirit more fully and leave something behind that time is kinder to than the flesh of gods . lucky there’s work . lucky the streets of heaven are in need of repair . paint is peeling from the dream - house trim . holy rainwater backs up in leaf - clogged gutters till the ceiling sags and tiles need regrouting . and look at the list of practical items for sale — used snowblowers , croquet sets , chainlink fencing . and what about a wooden canoe with two paddles . why don’t we make time for a turn before sundown ? out on the broad lake a breeze will find us that’s wafted around the planet to cool our divinity . the clouds will hover above us in a giant halo as we watch our brother , the sun , descend , his gentle face turned toward us , his godly expression undarkened by accusation or disappointment or the thought of something he’s left undone .

"if only i could forget him , the frenchman i saw outside our quarters , creeping round near daybreak in that density of garden as if he would almost grown into the ground . he was just looking back , peering about him to check that he was safe here and alone : once he was sure , his plunder was all his ! whatever chanced , he would not be moving on . he was already eating . he was wolfing a pilfered turnip hidden in his rags . eating raw cattle feed . but he would no sooner swallowed a mouthful than it made him gag ; and the sweet food encountered on his tongue delight and then disgust , as it might be the unhappy and the happy , meeting in their bodies' all - consuming ecstasy . only forget that body . . . shoulder blades trembling , and a hand all skin and bone , the palm cramming his mouth in such a way that it too seemed to feed in clinging on . and then the furious and desperate shame of organs galled with one another , forced to tear from one another what should bind them together in community at last . the way his clumsy feet had been left out of all that gibbering bestial joy ; and how they stood splayed out and paralyzed beneath the body's torture and fierce rapture now . and his look too — if i could forget that ! retching , he went on gobbling as if driven on and on , just to eat , no matter what , anything , this or that , himself even . why go on ? it turned out that he would escaped from the prison camp nearby — guards came for him . i wander , as i did then in that garden , among my garden shadows here at home . "" if only i could forget him , the frenchman "" — i'm looking through my notes , i read one out , and from my ears , my eyes , my mouth , the seething memory boils over in his shout : "" i'm hungry !

"i am a 21 year old male from the uk who has recently graduated from university , although i did the majority of my final semester , including writing my dissertation , back in my rural home county . academically , i did quite well , graduating with first class honours , but i am at this moment pretty directionless and feel like i have not made the most of my opportunities . my first year at university was made difficult after the unexpected death of my stepdad via alcohol poisoning . two weeks prior to this my mum had told me she had left him as she did not love him anymore . all of this happened whilst i was away studying in a city in the south , and after i returned there after the funeral i shut my family out including my mother , as at the time i blamed her for his death , which i viewed as a suicide due to being heartbroken . so i stayed down at my uni - town for the majority of my degree , including over christmases and through the summers . mentally , i was not doing well , the disruption in first year meant that i failed to make many friends , and i developed a pretty bad binge - drinking problem which would create a lot of disruption for me , i . e . losing my phone , wallet , cards , and more embarrassingly stumbling around the house and quite often barging into someone else bedroom accidentally in the middle of the night and scaring them . another thing i neglected to do was apply for summer internships and work experience opportunities , which in the uk are usually only open to students in their first or penultimate year at university , which will become more relevant later . it was not until the second semester of second year that things got better for me . i started dating my current boyfriend , who is from poland , and who is quite different from myself . he is very used to personal , emotional , and financial support from his parents , and consequently has a very good self - esteem as well as a great academic and professional record . for example , in the summer after i met him , he partook in an internship at the un in new york for the polish delegation , something i would never be able to consider due to it being unpaid , meaning he relied on his parents to support him . although i would say we are very much in love i would say the our essences are completely distinct and this is based off our upbringings and experiences . he is very much an optimist , and believes anyone can do anything if they put there mind to it . i myself am probably the biggest pessimist and this is where we clash . sometimes i remind him that not everyone is afforded the same resources at his disposal , although it can get a bit personal as i am inferring people like myself , and i suppose i am jealous of him in a way . anyways , despite us being different i can say he did change my outlook for the better . seeing him do all of his impressive extracurricular activities made me conscious of my lack of professional experiences , but by this time it was the start of my final year and it felt like it was a race to get something before graduation . it did not help that my boyfriend is very keen on one day working for some sort of international organisation ( eu or the un ) , and i worried about how i could figure in around this and also find a job wherever he might end up . i applied for lots of different things in my final year , ( graduate schemes and jobs , summer internships ) and at first i could handle setbacks and rejections , as i truly felt that i was learning something even by just applying . eventually , i started getting acceptances , and i was happy to find out i had gotten a place working as a summer intern for the ministry of justice . i also started the process of getting help with my depression by going to my university's health service . i suffer with insomnia also and was given amitriptyline but in a very low dose so not as antidepressant medication but just to help falling to sleep easier . as you will all know , in march covid restrictions started coming in , and my boyfriend got a last minute flight to poland , and i eventually went back to my home county , but this time i lived with my dad . i do not have a close relationship at all with my dad , i had not lived with him since the age of 4 , and we do not have a lot in common least of all me being gay and him being the biggest womaniser ever . as i still had my dissertation to write , and i was used to working sporadically through the night , i set up my pc in his rv outside to minimise noise , and i slept in it also too eventually . i also found that the amitriptyline was not working as well so when i ran out did not bother contacting the doctor's as i would be unable to make an appointment anyway , and for the most part was more concerned with writing my dissertation anyway . so in june , a week before i was due to start work , i was informed that the internship would be cancelled , which was disappointing to say the least as in the back of my mind i was still concerned with my lack of professional experience . the next set - back came when i was approached by a recruiter for a bank who found my cv online and invited my to apply for this temporary 3 month position . this would have worked out quite well as i had also applied for this scholarship to study a masters at the university of warsaw financed by the polish government , due to start in october . i did the video interview and the day after the offered me the job after which followed a 2 week period of acquiring all the necessary documentation , and background checks , very similar to what i had to do with the ministry of justice . after i had did all this , i received a call from the recruiter who explained that due to 'company restructuring' they had to postpone my starting for an unspecified period of time . about a week after this , around august 24 , i found out that i had received the scholarship off the polish government to do the masters and i was ecstatic , although now not having a job created the stress of having to come up with the money needed to move countries . the legal fees to get my diploma legalised and sent over to poland in time amount to just under £ 400 and to pay for it i sold my gaming pc , which i was willing to do as it felt like getting this scholarship would single handedly solve all my problems : of not being able to find a job in the post - covid economy , of the difficult situation of living with my distant father , of being so far away from my boyfriend . however , on friday i got an email from the university in poland to say that due to an insufficient number of students my course would not be going ahead , this was two days before i needed to show the polish scholarship agency my enrolment letter to secure my scholarship . this really destroyed me . throughout all of these set backs i have tried my best to stay positive , but it got progressively harder with each opportunity . a lot of them demonstrated how people will be prepared to be nice and lead you on , like the recruiter who contacted me , or the admissions at the university in poland , but will be prepared to drop you at a moments notice when it is no longer convenient for them . i just feel like i spent so much time trying to condition myself out of my pessimistic world view but every time i find myself proven right . the past 6 months have really built up my hopes before tearing them down to even lower than they were before . i have started the binge - drinking again , and the other day i must have alluded to suicidal thoughts whilst video calling my boyfriend , though i do not recall it , as he took it upon himself to add my mother and facebook and message her about it . i feel like i am having a breakdown but unsure with how to respond . i am also no registered to a doctor's office in my county , due to being registered with the university health service thought i imagine since i have graduated i am off the books .

"as a child i parleyed with animals , stuffed and real . making my kitten pilot of a boot , i guided from one end of a string the dizzy flight and collapse . i was fearful of people as well as things , and my faithful toy shepherd with his painted face sat by me on the bed in the gloom . i was disdainful of dolls as weak people . in the favorite story i told myself my parents were made over into fair - limbed , brave angels who smiled into their god’s eyes when summoned . i was benevolent , afraid to let go of this image at night because i couldn’t hide deep enough under the covers to be overlooked by death , the angel bending over me who had been wronged . i read histories of queens , regal and barbarian , whose leopard’s eyes restrained man or wild beast . i rambled along tidal rivers and in the marshes where the green - golden grasses dazzled the sun , and felt the ache of sea - air in my lungs . i saw water spume near atlantic cliffs . i examined lichen . i saw great light drown darkness . then at thirteen i lay in the bleak bed before sleep and heard the pleadings and the murderous kisses ; and burned , like a bear his fat , my soul . i quaked at the sound of my voice whispering , no , or turned my face to the wall and wept salt onto my knuckles . in the serene light of sun - up , before sparrows tumbled up from the earth , whispering and singing , and the exquisite sea and sky mobilized their heavy , blue currents , i was consoled . i walked through beauty without knowing why and told no one , wanting nothing else to touch me and never to move anyone in any way . i hid away from the house and learned the dark was not a dream but could show the pale gravel of a real driveway . i saw for the first time later the new moon and the full moon in one piece . i no longer feared the night , night like a bear at ease in his wide habitat . in the greatness of such space i said , this is me .

"still half drunk , after a night at cards , with the grey dawn taking us unaware among our guilty kings and queens , we drove far north in the morning , winners , losers , to a stream in the high hills , to climb up to a place one of us knew , with some vague view of cutting losses or consolidating gains by the old standard appeal to the wilderness , the desert , the empty places of our exile , bringing only the biblical bread and cheese and cigarettes got from a grocer’s on the way , expecting to drink only the clear cold water among the stones , and remember , or forget . though no one said anything about atonement , there was still some purgatorial idea in all those aching heads and ageing hearts as we climbed the giant stair of the stream , reaching the place around noon . it was as promised , a wonder , with granite walls enclosing ledges , long and flat , of limestone , or , rolling , of lava ; within the ledges the water , fast and still , pouring its yellow light , and green , over the tilted slabs of the floor , blackened at shady corners , falling in a foam of crystal to a calm where the waterlight dappled the ledges as they leaned against the sun ; big blue dragonflies hovered and darted and dipped a wing , hovered again against the low wind moving over the stream , and shook the flakes of light from their clear wings . this surely was it , was what we had come for , was nature , though it looked like art with its grey fortress walls and laminated benches as in the waiting room of some petrified station . but we believed ; and what it was we believed made of the place a paradise for ruined poker players , win or lose , who stripped naked and bathed and dried out on the rocks like gasping trout ( the water they drank making them drunk again ) , lit cigarettes and lay back waiting for nature to say the last word — as though the stones were memnon stones , which , caught in a certain light , would sing . the silence ( and even the noise of the waters was silence ) grew pregnant ; that is the phrase , grew pregnant ; but nothing else did . the mountains brought forth not a mouse , and the rocks , unlike the ones you would expect to find on the slopes of purgatory or near helicon , mollified by muses and with a little give to ’em , were modern american rocks , and hard as rocks . our easy bones groaned , our flesh baked on one side and shuddered on the other ; and each man thought bitterly about primitive simplicity and decadence , and how he had been ruined by civilization and forced by circumstances to drink and smoke and sit up all night inspecting those perfectly arbitrary cards until he was broken - winded as a trout on a rock and had no use for the doctrines of jean jacques rousseau , and could no longer afford a savagery whether noble or not ; some would never batter that battered copy of walden again . but all the same , the water , the sunlight , and the wind did something ; even the dragonflies did something to the minds full of telephone numbers and flushes , to the flesh sweating bourbon on one side and freezing on the other . and the rocks , the old and tumbling boulders which formed the giant stair of the stream , induced ( again ) some purgatorial ideas concerning humility , concerning patience and enduring what had to be endured , winning and losing and breaking even ; ideas of weathering in whatever weather , being eroded , or broken , or ground down into pebbles by the stream’s necessitous and grave currents . but to these ideas did any purgatory respond ? only this one : that in a world where even the memnon stones were carved in soap one might at any rate wash with the soap . after a time we talked about the war , about what we had done in the war , and how near some of us had been to being drowned , and burned , and shot , and how many people we knew who had been drowned , or burned , or shot ; and would it have been better to have died in the war , the peaceful old war , where we were young ? but the mineral peace , or paralysis , of those great stones , the moving stillness of the waters , entered our speech ; the ribs and blood of the earth , from which all fables grow , established poetry and truth in us , so that at last one said , “ i shall play cards until the day i die , ” and another said , “ in bourbon whisky are all the vitamins and minerals needed to sustain man’s life , ” and still another , “ i shall live on smoke until my spirit has been cured of flesh . ” climbing downstream again , on the way home to the lives we had left empty for a day , we noticed , as not before , how of three bridges not one had held the stream , which in its floods had twisted the girders , splintered the boards , hurled boulder on boulder , and had broken into rubble , smashed practically back to nature , the massive masonry of span after span with its indifferent rage ; this was a sight that sobered us considerably , and kept us quiet both during the long drive home and after , till it was time to deal the cards .

"can we not force from widow'd poetry , now thou art dead ( great donne ) one elegy to crown thy hearse ? why yet dare we not trust , though with unkneaded dough - bak'd prose , thy dust , such as th' unscissor'd churchman from the flower of fading rhetoric , short - liv'd as his hour , dry as the sand that measures it , should lay upon thy ashes , on the funeral day ? have we no voice , no tune ? didst thou dispense through all our language , both the words and sense ? 'tis a sad truth . the pulpit may her plain and sober christian precepts still retain , doctrines it may , and wholesome uses , frame , grave homilies and lectures , but the flame of thy brave soul ( that shot such heat and light as burnt our earth and made our darkness bright , committed holy rapes upon our will , did through the eye the melting heart distil , and the deep knowledge of dark truths so teach as sense might judge what fancy could not reach ) must be desir'd forever . so the fire that fills with spirit and heat the delphic quire , which , kindled first by thy promethean breath , glow'd here a while , lies quench'd now in thy death . the muses' garden , with pedantic weeds o'erspread , was purg'd by thee ; the lazy seeds of servile imitation thrown away , and fresh invention planted ; thou didst pay the debts of our penurious bankrupt age ; licentious thefts , that make poetic rage a mimic fury , when our souls must be possess'd , or with anacreon's ecstasy , or pindar's , not their own ; the subtle cheat of sly exchanges , and the juggling feat of two - edg'd words , or whatsoever wrong by ours was done the greek or latin tongue , thou hast redeem'd , and open'd us a mine of rich and pregnant fancy ; drawn a line of masculine expression , which had good old orpheus seen , or all the ancient brood our superstitious fools admire , and hold their lead more precious than thy burnish'd gold , thou hadst been their exchequer , and no more they each in other's dust had rak'd for ore . thou shalt yield no precedence , but of time , and the blind fate of language , whose tun'd chime more charms the outward sense ; yet thou mayst claim from so great disadvantage greater fame , since to the awe of thy imperious wit our stubborn language bends , made only fit with her tough thick - ribb'd hoops to gird about thy giant fancy , which had prov'd too stout for their soft melting phrases . as in time they had the start , so did they cull the prime buds of invention many a hundred year , and left the rifled fields , besides the fear to touch their harvest ; yet from those bare lands of what is purely thine , thy only hands , ( and that thy smallest work ) have gleaned more than all those times and tongues could reap before . but thou art gone , and thy strict laws will be too hard for libertines in poetry ; they will repeal the goodly exil'd train of gods and goddesses , which in thy just reign were banish'd nobler poems ; now with these , the silenc'd tales o' th'metamorphoses shall stuff their lines , and swell the windy page , till verse , refin'd by thee , in this last age turn ballad rhyme , or those old idols be ador'd again , with new apostasy . oh , pardon me , that break with untun'd verse the reverend silence that attends thy hearse , whose awful solemn murmurs were to thee , more than these faint lines , a loud elegy , that did proclaim in a dumb eloquence the death of all the arts ; whose influence , grown feeble , in these panting numbers lies , gasping short - winded accents , and so dies . so doth the swiftly turning wheel not stand in th' instant we withdraw the moving hand , but some small time maintain a faint weak course , by virtue of the first impulsive force ; and so , whilst i cast on thy funeral pile thy crown of bays , oh , let it crack awhile , and spit disdain , till the devouring flashes suck all the moisture up , then turn to ashes . i will not draw the envy to engross all thy perfections , or weep all our loss ; those are too numerous for an elegy , and this too great to be express'd by me . though every pen should share a distinct part , yet art thou theme enough to tire all art ; let others carve the rest , it shall suffice i on thy tomb this epitaph incise : here lies a king , that rul'd as he thought fit the universal monarchy of wit ; here lie two flamens , and both those , the best , apollo's first , at last , the true god's priest .

"the batture’s water and sand disappear when water swells the river , heat’s portion of a northern winter . under willows cropped up since our last cow is dead and carried to the batture to be taken by the water clean into another season , we sit on green granite piled deep enough to keep the batture dry one more week . we don’t say so but we wait for the swollen body to appear before us , we want the torn leg to distract us , the loose arm to show us where . we’ve always known which way the water runs , the differences among earth , air , water and whatever the horizon offers that is not actually there . we want to be the ones to identify the missing person . we count the reward we’d earn . there is a family in southern minnesota keeping a closet of dry - cleaned suits , a mahogany high - boy of ironed shirts , folded undershorts and sweaters . in the ashtray that says welcome to nevada are the coins he left without thinking , the only clue which tells his family what they didn’t want to know , he might have known what he was doing . we want to be the ones whose call is first in a series of related events which will end we hope in the family’s satisfaction with the coroner’s identification , and though it is old - fashioned and no longer done in this country , we’d like to think the pennies from his pocket will be mailed to the morgue , polished to their copper finish , pressed to float forever on his eyelids and make us take a second look as the light hits them and they beautifully glitter . we think how glad we were when we first saw him he floated face down in the water which a few moments earlier had been snow his children sledded and slipped on . light beats gravity , lifts these young trees from the water . this is where we watch time , mark the spot across the water which is the red flag we hope calls us come across and save us . this is twenty - eight states .

"knoxville , december 27 , 2016 , for marilyn kallet’s 70th birthday . this poem was constructed to carry any memory you want to hold close . we arrived when the days grew legs of night . chocolates were offered . we ate latkes for hours to celebrate light and friends . we will keep going despite dark or a madman in a white house dream . let’s talk about something else said the dog who begs faithfully at the door of goodwill : a biscuit will do , a voice of reason , meat sticks — i dreamed all of this i told her , you , me , and paris — it was impossible to make it through the tragedy without poetry . what are we without winds becoming words ? becoming old children born to children born to sing us into love . another level of love , beyond the neighbor’s holiday light display proclaiming goodwill to all men who have lost their way in the dark as they tried to find the car door , the bottle hidden behind the seat , reason to keep on going past all the times they failed at sharing love , love . it’s weak they think — or some romantic bullshit , a movie set propped up behind on slats , said the wizard of junk understanding who pretends to be the wise all - knowing dog behind a cheap fan . it’s in the plan for the new world straining to break through the floor of this one , said the angel of all - that - you - know - and - forgot - and - will - find , as she flutters the edge of your mind when you try to sing the blues to the future of everything that might happen and will . all the losses come tumbling down , down , down at three in the morning as do all the shouldn’t - haves or should - haves . it doesn’t matter , girl — i’ll be here to pick you up , said memory , in her red shoes , and the dress that showed off brown legs . when you met him at the age you have always loved , hair perfect with a little wave , and that shine in your skin from believing what was impossible was possible , you were not afraid . you stood up in love in a french story and there fell ever a light rain as you crossed the seine to meet him for café in saint - germain - des - prés . you wrote a poem beneath the tender skin from your ribs to your hip bone , in the slender then , and you are still writing that song to convince the sweetness of every bit of straggling moonlight , star and sunlight to become words in your mouth , in your kiss — that kiss that will never die , you will all ways fall in love . it doesn’t matter how old , how many days , hours , or memories , we can fall in love over and over again . the seine or tennessee or any river with a soul knows the depths descending when it comes to seeing the sun or moon stare back , without shame , remorse , or guilt . this is what i remember she told her husband when they bedded down that night in the house that would begin marriage . that house was built of twenty - four doves , rugs from india , cooking recipes from seven generations of mothers and their sisters , and wave upon wave of tears , and the concrete of resolution for the steps that continue all the way to the heavens , past guardian dogs , dog after dog to protect . they are humble earth angels , and the rowdiest , even nasty . you try and lick yourself like that , imagine . and the old woman laughed as she slipped off her cheap shoes and parked them under the bed that lies at the center of the garden of good and evil . she’d seen it all . done it more than once . tonight , she just wanted a good sleep , and picked up the book of poetry by her bed , which was over a journal she kept when her mother was dying . these words from may sarton she kept in the fourth room of her heart , “ love , come upon him warily and deep / for if he startle first it were as well / to bind a fox’s throat with a gold bell / as hold him when it is his will to leap . ” and she considered that every line of a poem was a lead line into the spirit world to capture a bit of memory , pieces of gold confetti , a kind of celebration . we all want to be remembered , even memory , even the way the light came in the kitchen window , when her mother turned up the dial on that cool mist color of a radio , when memory crossed the path of longing and took mother’s arm and she put down her apron said , “ i don’t mind if i do , ” and they danced , you watching , as you began your own cache of remembering . already you had stored the taste of mother as milk , father as a labor of sweat and love , and night as a lonely boat of stars that took you into who you were before you slid through the hips of the story . there are no words when you cross the gate of forbidden waters , or is it a sheer scarf of the finest silk , or is it something else that causes you to forget . nothing is ever forgotten says the god of remembering who protects the heartbeat of every little cell of knowing from the antarctic to the soft spot at the top of this planetary baby . oh baby , come here , let me tell you the story of the party you will never forget , no matter where you go , where you are , or where you will be when you cross the line and say , no more . no more greedy kings , no more disappointments , no more orphans , or thefts of souls or lands , no more killing for the sport of killing . no more , no more , except more of the story so i will understand exactly what i am doing here , and why , she said to the fox guardian who took her arm to help her cross the road that was given to the care of natives who made sure the earth spirits were fed with songs , and the other things they loved to eat . they like sweets , cookies , and flowers . it was getting late and the fox guardian picked up her books as she hurried through the streets of strife . but it wasn’t getting late . there was no late , only a plate of tamales on the counter waiting to be or not to be . at this age , said the fox , we are closer to the not to be , which is the to be in the fields of sweet grasses . wherever you are , enjoy the evening , how the sun walks the horizon before cross sing over to be , and we then exist under the realm of the moon . there’s where fears slay us , in the dark of the howling mind . we all battle . befriend them , the moon said as a crab skittered under her skirt , her daughter in the high chair , waiting for cereal and toast . what a girl she turned out to be , a willow tree , a blessing to the winds , to her family . there she is married , and we start the story all over again , said her father in a toast to the happiness of who we are and who we are becoming as change in a new model sedan whips it down the freeway toward the generations that follow , one after another in the original lands of the mvskoke who are still here . nobody goes anywhere though we are always leaving and returning . it’s a ceremony . sunrise occurs everywhere , in lizard time , human time , or a fern uncurling time . we instinctually reach for light food , we digest it , make love , art or trouble of it . the sun crowns us at noon . the whole earth is a queen . then there are always goodbyes . at sunset say goodbye to hurt , to suffering , to the pain you caused others , or yourself . goodbye , goodbye , to carrie fisher , the star wars phenomenon , and george michael , the singer . they were planets in our emotional universe . some of my memories are opened by the image of love on screen in an imagined future , or broken open when the sax solo of “ careless whisper ” blows through the communal heart . yes , there’s a cosmic consciousness . jung named it but it was there long before named by vedic and mvskoke scientists . and , there is a cosmic hearteousness — for the heart is the higher mind and nothing can be forgotten there , no ever or ever . how do i sing this so i don’t forget ? ask the poets . each word is a box that can be opened or closed . then a train of words , phrases garnered by music and the need for rhythm to organize chaos . like right here , now , in this poem is the transition phase . i remembered it while giving birth , summer sun bearing down on the city melting asphalt but there we were , my daughter and i , at the door between worlds . i was happier than ever before to welcome her , happiness was the path she chose to enter , and i couldn’t push yet , not yet , and then there appeared a pool of the bluest water . we waited there for a breath to catch up , and then it did , and she took it that girl who was beautiful beyond dolphin dreaming , and we made it , we did , to the other side of suffering . this is the story our mothers tell but we couldn’t hear it in our ears stuffed with barbie advertising , with our mothers’ own loathing set in place by patriarchal scripture , the smothering rules to stop insurrection by domesticated slaves , or wives . it hurt everybody . the fathers cannot know what they are feeling in such a spiritual backwash . worship boxes set into place by the need for money and power will not beget freedom . only warships . for freedom , freedom , oh freedom sang the slaves , the oar rhythm of the blues lifting up the spirits of peoples whose bodies were worn out , or destroyed by a man’s slash , hit of greed . this is our memory too , said america . heredity is a field of blood , celebration , and forgetfulness . don’t take on more than you can carry , said the eagle to his twin sons , fighting each other in the sky over a fox , dangling between them . it’s that time of the year , when we eat tamales and latkes . we light candles , fires to make the way for a newborn child , for fresh understanding . demons will try to make houses out of jealousy , anger , pride , greed , or more destructive material . they place them in a part of the body that will hold them : liver , heart , knee , or brain . so , my friend , let’s let that go , for joy , for chocolates made of ashes , mangos , grapefruit , or chili from oaxaca , for sparkling wine from spain , for these children who show up in our dreams and want to live at any cost because we are here to feed them joy . your soul is so finely woven the silkworms went on strike , said the mulberry tree . we all have mulberry trees in the memory yard . they hold the place for skinned knees earned by small braveries , cousins you love who are gone , a father cutting a watermelon in the summer on the porch , and a mother so in love that her heart breaks — it will never be the same , yet all memory bends to fit . the heart has uncountable rooms . we turn to leave here , and so will the hedgehog who makes a home next to that porch . we become birds , poems .

"somebody who would never refuse money told me this — about the syncretic effect when each person plugs their attention into a field to read ad copy , let’s just say they become opened up and other beings can see into their minds . this was considered a science fiction idea to many people , but not to me . in my negative space construction is always occurring . the liftoff from awful to tolerable to positive and then finally to bright new beautiful has been my most difficult task to swing . but swing i will ; there’s nothing else to do . i live here and being here and hearing myself or my mind’s divide through others convinces me that i must do everything i can to save us from the pit . that is , until the pit splits and the fruit tree finally grows . you may have a tree of your own — you may have a home in your own tree . congratulations . if you write an instructive pamphlet you can bet i will read it . i do not want to go out in darkness . i am doing everything i know to prevent this , and thank you , by the way , if you’ve written a pamphlet . the shared information system and each being at the end of its screen emits an led ( light emitting diode ) on an often green screen — you say i should give my father up to the authorities . you blame your circumstances on my choice — but it’s the authorities who did this to him . how do you think a person loses his mind ? he let someone take it . he is sort of my mind and you are too , god help me . the green screen is an ingenious discovery . you can record events in a studio before the screen and then key in whatever environment you like . it’s a special color : chroma green , but it can be blue too . the experience of things is determined by our feelings about them . information is colored by us . you may see remotely , in a photograph for instance , the image of an ambush victim . maybe it is a war and / or she is caught naked . if she is unhappy — indicated by face and body arrangement — you may feel that . some people will hate the state of things that made her so alone and vulnerable but few will do anything about it . how do you find her ? what guns surround her country ? and after all , maybe she would hate it . to have to feel grateful to someone moved by her humiliation . she may only be thinking about humiliation . that is a tough feeling to shake . then , and i need not go too far into this , then there are those who see the pain of someone and they just love it . this may have something to do with a revenge sentiment over their own unclosed wound . the wound , they think , is everyone else’s fault and they cannot forgive . this is only information , in the form of speculation . some feelings you get when you consider “ what if this happened to me ? ” and you will want to remedy the situation to secure yourself from the ( negative ) condition of it . together , humans create one body — the planet earth and its projections . the things in the stomach affect what goes on in the head . on the web many people make money with miracle potions . some curb the human appetite . some say you can lose while consuming whatever you want . i heard the other girl refer to me as a skull . she was very angry and did not look or say hello . there is a prevalent competitive notion that each only has one place . that her face is only hers and that i don’t have a face or to her it is death . this she reads as me — the death of her . obviously i am not . i write and read and then roll on . i wear an ordinary human face , some could compare me to a bird of prey because my nose is hooked and my fingers are long and i like to ride my bicycle with the wind at my back . i am not here to attack . you are also a mutant . do you think you can keep the heavy metals outside of you ? do you think you can go to sleep here and wake up the same ? the screen is framed by plastic , beneath that you use words to issue commandments or call - outs . most people use the web to send messages to people who are already their friends . they make arrangements for later and detail what happened in the past . this information may be not true . the web cannot know intention . it records and is open to influence . people make money through advertisements , or so they think — well , selling ads , that’s quantifiable — if ads make money , that is more difficult to know unless there are special offers . the web is full of special offers and 30 - day trials . if you fall for those , or i should say , if you respond to the offer what often happens is that your information is shared with other companies who will fill your inbox with offers ( that which is known as spam ) . because you are someone who wants to look great and there are other companies with products compatible with your stated desire . ways for you to achieve the prevailing notion of beauty . it is my job to tell you the models are selected because they are physically improbable . they are elevated to be made desirable . their desirability is physical because they are models . if it were easy to be like that , they would not be sought - after by manufacturers . generally , working people need to be sturdy . advertisers want to make money . they go with psychology and so create a sort of self - rejection by advocating forms not reflected in most people . they know that people will pay in to be of an elevated form no matter what station they are from . everyone wants to be beautiful . everyone wants to be the agreed - upon beautiful thing . probably everyone is beautiful somewhere inside if not outside . you can create an excellent argument for your being and improve upon ability . that is my opinion . if you live alone , you may know how great the web can be . on it there is information and pornography . information includes the prospects . pornography is the biggest industry in america . it is designed to bring about a certain state of arousal , generally , couched in anger that will allow the person to fuck exactly how they want to without worrying about the one fucked . pornography is addictive for many . of course , sometimes people want to touch , to hear a voice to imagine a partner and what they can do together . the web has many dating services . my ex - psychiatrist advised me against trying them . she had transferred the daughter role onto me . i do appreciate the dangers of strangers . i am prepared with the information that pictures are not people in both obvious and non - obvious ways . i know at least three people who have been in love with people they met online . each one is intelligent and down - to - earth . i’ve gleaned from their descriptions of online courting that the early questions are essential . that and no expectation and somehow you have to withhold your own personal information . that is , until you meet up in a non - threatening place . you will have to have someone know where you are , a point person . and you will need a defense ; mace , for instance or a rape whistle or a dog leashed nearby or in the car . it will be important for him or her to know you have a dog . they should meet each other as soon as possible . this is the magic of the machine . the meeting and love trial and , if it works , the love made . well , that really is amazing . objectively amazing . and good for the machine . good for the machine . the electric web courses heavily through me . this may be how we make history : we can put up our movies , our words , or costume dramas . we say we are so and so and people follow the saga . do you ever get the problem which is opposite to the problem of the watcher ? have you ever only seen yourself through other people ? or thought that’s what it was but it was really your thought processes transferred through them ? i should look up the word rubric again . that and lacuna and devi . in the thrift store nobody looked at me . but the woman said , “ devi ( hee , hee ) devi . ” a celestial being : what we all are . true she might have meant devil . i am not a devil . i love my friends most of the time . i love animals — i don’t think devils do that . my friend sends me pictures of jackrabbits and frogs . yesterday , he said he saw buttercups , a type of flower . you go over the tracks first , on the other side of the river and there they are .

"so , there is this little shack we have where we keep tools and other stuff inside . i remember it was 4 : 53 am and everybody was sleeping . i took the chance and went to the shack , locked the door . i could not find any ropes so i decided to use a cable . it was an old and crusty table , probably been there for 10 years but i said fuck it , it was the best i could find . so i put a table down and tie the cable to the wooden planks on the ceiling which are showing up . i tie it to my neck and kick the table with my foot . i am almost losing consciousness but then the old , crusty cable decides to break and i fall onto the ground . i was short of air , breathing really heavily , my face is all red and i cannot hear properly . but i remember that i heard someone from the house wake up and i heard the window open from another room , then i heard it close . seems like someone heard it but did not understand what it was and they went back to sleep . while i was tied there i was happy that it was going to end but there was also this instinct that kept making me want to break out , it is a strange feeling . i do not know if i will end up like this again , but until then i will be wasting some oxygen i guess . nobody noticed what i did so i just went straight into my room again with tears and a red face and i could not sleep that night . i have not told this to anyone in real life and i do not think i ever will care enough to do so .

"‘i have always felt that desolation , that hell itself , is most powerfully expressed in an uninhabited natural landscape at its bleakest . ’ — anthony hecht 1 . to each his own hell . mine was an uninhabited landscape as far from nature as you can get without actually leaving the planet , a man - made moon waste on sixth avenue in brooklyn , fired in the sun’s kiln through unending afternoons when i was nine or ten . i can never get the whole scene put together in my head , thanks to whatever guardian spirit flags down potentially dangerous intruders on the verge of memory , but parts of me hold parts of it : my ears play out the hissing wires’ repeated rise and fall , dry waves breaking above pavement ; my nostrils chafe where fumes of gasoline weep from soft tarred patches in the asphalt ; through a chainlink grid , my eyes take in some lot’s trapped beach , its black sand an amalgam of gravel , soot , and broken glass ; or they blink in sequence with the traffic light’s perpetual solitaire at a carless intersection , flicking over greens , ambers , reds ; my hands remember enough not to touch the shut steel trap doors of delivery chutes where air trembles over surfaces as at their beginnings in a furnace . what fills my mind to bursting is emptiness , the spirit of inverted genesis transforming light and water’s urge towards fullness into a miracle of unearthly loss . 2 . sentries , a pair of gasoline pumps napped . their rubber arms dangled groundwards and looped back up , hanging slack from the brass lapel their trigger - fingers hooked at shoulder height . they were no angels , but kept the gate of hell whenever i made visits to the angels . behind them , next to a roll - up garage door always rolled up , with an invisible car always risen above the stone lintel on the hydraulic lift , a soft drink cooler sat coffin - like against the stucco wall . and always songs from a hidden radio promised cool mountain rivers to the hot flat city : somebody else must have listened , but i never saw a soul in all my visits . the angels’ wings fluttered the moment i raised the lid , a potent shimmer , as if the sun itself shone from the chest , not its reflections playing off the steel bars and icy waters . the angels sat in rows between the bars , their orders chevroned by the shapes and colours of their glass capes : the bluish , scalloped whorl of cherubim , the powers’ straight sheer crystal , the emerald flare of flaming seraphim — all emissaries from the sky - washed shore of heaven . to put a coin in the dispenser , slide one of them along its plated channel and lift it free through the chest’s narrow gate — to kiss the cold stars of its distillation — was not important ; it was only important to see the angels swimming in the glitter and dip my fingers in their flickering water at the centre of that man - made desert , knowing that they were man - made , and might shatter .

"my ex girlfriend broke up with in march , we were together for 4 months , and she was my first love . i had sexual partners previous to her but none with an emotional connection . i treated her like a queen , i bought her jewelry , wrote her notes , gave her jackets , and i try to do everything in my power to show my affection , i’m 17 btw for reference , anyways she dumped me and i was broken for awhile but since we kept in contact we really didn’t stop until july . i hadn’t talked to her in weeks and yesterday was her little sisters birthday so i told her to say happy birthday , i got no response . the next day she called me and told me she never wants to see me ever again in her entire life . she told me i was abusive and that in our relationship i was not in love with the “ real her ” and that she was putting a facade on to emotionally appease me . she said that if she walked into a room and i was there she would walk out and that i don’t even deserve to hear her voice . during the weeks i didn’t talk i began to feel better but not completely healed , this phone called ruined my day . she was also a part of a close friend group of me and we were all really close , people i could trust , and i’ve noticed one by one they all have ghosted me and she , of course , blocked me . i cried for hours , screaming and crying , untill i got a headache and even when it hurt i continued to cry . i have no one now . it’s my senior year of high school , i can’t see anyone , the medication i was prescribed isn’t working and i hate the side effects , my mom is in the hospital for medical reasons , my sister has special needs and doesn’t know how to speak , i hate online school and i spend every day in regret and sorrow of my past relationship and how it’ll never be the same again . in my county we go back to school november 5th and i don’t even want to be in situation to see her . i try to keep myself active and healthy , i eat well , take vitamins , lift 3 times a week , go to practice twice a week , i have a job as a tutor for special needs kids on the side , i keep myself busy but i’m still heartbroken , i heard she hooked up with someone else after our breakup and it really hurts , i can’t go a day without crying , today i cried in the middle of an economics test , i am a stellar student i have a 4 . 47 gpa and a good sat score but due to all this emotional trouble in failing so many classes . i almost want to transfer school . the first thing i think when i wake up is how awesome my life was and how i can’t have it ever again . i am extremely depressed , i also have ed erectile dysfunction because of my depression and another condition called pelvic floor dysfunction which stem from depression and anxiety . i don’t understand what’s wrong with me . i don’t know , i might also add another person at our school is spreading rumors about me saying i’m “ toxic ” but i don’t understand , i spoiled my ex , i was selfless , i don’t know how to deal with the pain and how much it hurts . i have a psychiatrist and two therapists , and i’m still deeply sad . i don’t think the medication helps because my brain chemistry is most likely fine and it’s most likely social trauma . so yea , fuck life . thinking about buying a fake id and getting a gun and blowing my brains out , i know it’s stupid and selfish , and would make people feel guilty and sorrowful , but i’m numb , and it seems like a viable solution .

"i drove to oak park , took two tours , and looked at some of the houses . i took the long way back along the lake . the place that i came home to — a cavernous apartment on the east side of milwaukee — seems basically a part of that tradition , with the same admixture of expansion and restraint : the space takes off , yet leaves behind a nagging feeling of confinement , with the disconcerting sense that while the superficial conflicts got resolved , the underlying tensions brought to equilibrium , it isn’t yet a place in which i feel that i can live . imagine someone reading . contemplate a man oblivious to his settings , and then a distant person standing in an ordinary room , hemmed in by limitations , yet possessed by the illusion of an individual life that blooms within its own mysterious enclosure , in a solitary space in which the soul can breathe and where the heart can stay — not by discovering it , but by creating it , by giving it a self - sustaining atmosphere of depth , both in the architecture , and in the unconstructed life that it contains . in a late and very brief remark , freud speculates that space is the projection of a “ psychic apparatus ” which remains almost entirely oblivious to itself ; and wright extols “ that primitive sense of shelter ” which can turn a house into a refuge from despair . i wish that time could bring the future back again and let me see things as they used to seem to me before i found myself alone , in an emancipated state — alone and free and filled with cares about tomorrow . there used to be a logic in the way time passed that made it flow directly towards an underlying space where all the minor , individual lives converged . the moments borrowed their perceptions from the past and bathed the future in a soft , familiar light i remembered from home , and which has faded . and the voices get supplanted by the rain , the nights seem colder , and the angel in the mind that used to sing to me beneath the wide suburban sky turns into dreamwork and dissolves into the air , while in its place a kind of monument appears , magnificent in isolation , compromised by proximity and standing in a small and singular expanse — as though the years had been a pretext for reflection , and my life had been a phase of disenchantment — as the faces that i cherished gradually withdraw , the reassuring settings slowly melt away , and what remains is just a sense of getting older . in a variation of the parable , the pure of heart descend into a kingdom that they never wanted and refused to see . the homely notions of the good , the quaint ideas of perfection swept away like adolescent fictions as the real forms of life deteriorate with manically increasing speed , the kind man wakes into a quiet dream of shelter , and the serenity it brings — not in reflection , but in the paralyzing fear of being mistaken , of losing everything , of acquiescing in the obvious approach ( the house shaped like a box ; the life that can’t accommodate another’s ) — as the heart shrinks down to tiny , local things . why can’t the more expansive ecstasies come true ? i met you more than thirty years ago , in 1958 , in mrs . wolford’s eighth grade history class . all moments weigh the same , and matter equally ; yet those that time brings back create the fables of a happy or unsatisfying life , of minutes passing on the way to either peace or disappointment — like a paper calendar on which it’s always autumn and we’re back in school again ; or a hazy afternoon near the beginning of october , with the world series playing quietly on the radio , and the windows open , and the california sunlight filling up the room . when i survey the mural stretched across the years — across my heart — i notice mostly small , neglected parts of no importance to the whole design , but which , in their obscurity , seem more permanent and real . i see the desks and auditorium , suffused with yellow light connoting earnestness and hope that still remains there , in a space pervaded by a soft and supple ache too deep to contemplate — as though the future weren’t real , and the present were amorphous , with nothing to hold on to , and the past were there forever . and the art that time inflicts upon its subjects can’t eradicate the lines sketched out in childhood , which harden into shapes as it recedes . i wish i knew a way of looking at the world that didn’t find it wanting , or of looking at my life that didn’t always see a half - completed structure made of years and filled with images and gestures emblematic of the past , like gatsby’s light , or proust’s imbalance on the stones . i wish there were a place where i could stay and leave the world alone — an enormous stadium where i could wander back and forth across a field replete with all the incidents and small details that gave the days their textures , that bound the minutes into something solid , and that linked them all together in a way that used to seem eternal . we used to go to dances in my family’s ancient cadillac , which blew up late one summer evening climbing up the hill outside del mar . and later i can see us steaming off the cover of the beatles’ baby - butcher album at your house in mission bay ; and three years later listening to the velvet underground performing in a roller skating rink . years aren’t texts , or anything like texts ; and yet i often think of 1968 that way , as though that single year contained the rhythms of the rest , as what began in hope and eagerness concluded in intractable confusion , as the wedding turned into a puzzling fiasco over poor john godfrey’s hair . the parts were real , and yet the dense and living whole they once composed seems broken now , its voice reduced to disembodied terms that speak to me more distantly each day , until the tangled years are finally drained of feeling , and collapse into a sequence of the places where we lived : your parents’ house in kensington , and mine above the canyon : then the flat by sears in cambridge , where we moved when we got married , and the third floor of the house on francis avenue , near harvard square ; the big apartment in milwaukee where we lived the year that john was born , and last of all the house in whitefish bay , where you live now and all those years came inexplicably undone in mid - july . the sequence ended late last year . suppose we use a lifetime as a measure of the world as it exists for one . then half of mine has ended , while the fragment which has recently come to be contains no vantage point from which to see it whole . i think that people are the sum of their illusions , that the cares that make them difficult to see are eased by distance , with their errors blending in an intricate harmony , their truths abiding in a subtle “ spark ” or psyche ( each incomparable , yet each the same as all the others ) and their disparate careers all joined together in a tangled moral vision whose intense , meandering design seems lightened by a pure simplicity of feeling , as in grief , or in the pathos of a life cut off by loneliness , indifference or hate , because the most important thing is human happiness — not in the sense of private satisfactions , but of lives that realize themselves in ordinary terms and with the quiet inconsistencies that make them real . the whole transcends its tensions , like the intimate reflections on the day that came at evening , whose significance was usually overlooked , or misunderstood , because the facts were almost always unexceptional . two years ago we took our son to paris . last night i picked him up and took him to a lou reed show , and then took him home . i look at all the houses as i walk down hackett avenue to work . i teach my classes , visit friends , cook introspective meals for myself , yet in the end the minutes don’t add up . what’s lost is the perception of the world as something good and held in common ; as a place to be perfected in the kinds of everyday divisions and encounters that endowed it with integrity and structure , and that merged its private moments with the past . what broke it into pieces ? what transformed the flaws that gave it feeling into objects of a deep and smoldering resentment — like coming home too early , or walking too far ahead of you on the rue jacob ? i wish that life could be a window on the sun , instead of just this porch where i can stand and contemplate the wires that lace the parking lot and feel it moving towards some unknown resolution . the guggenheim museum just reopened . tonight i watched a segment of the news on pbs — narrated by a woman we met years ago at bob’s — that showed how most of wright’s interior had been restored , and how the ramp ascends in spirals towards the sky . i like the houses better — they flow in all directions , merging with the scenery and embodying a milder , more domestic notion of perfection , on a human scale that doesn’t overwhelm the life that it encloses . isn’t there a way to feel at home within the confines of this bland , accommodating structure made of souvenirs and emblems , like the hammock hanging in the backyard of an undistinguished prairie school house in whitefish bay — the lineal , reduced descendant of the “ flameproof ” wright house just a block or two away from where i live now ? i usually walk along the street on sunday , musing on how beautiful it seems , how aspects of it recapitulate the oak park house and studio , with open spaces buried in a labyrinthine interior , and with the entrance half - concealed on the side — a characteristic feature of his plans that made it difficult to find , although the hope was that in trying to get inside , the visitor’s eye would come to linger over subtleties he might have failed to see — in much the way that in the course of getting older , and trying to reconstruct the paths that led me here , i found myself pulled backwards through these old , uncertain passages , distracted by the details , and meeting only barriers to understanding why the years unfolded as they did , and why my life turned out the way it has — like his signature “ pathway of discovery , ” with each diversion adding to the integrity of the whole . there is this sweep life has that makes the accidents of time and place seem small . everything alters , and the personal concerns that love could hold together for a little while decay , and then the world seems strange again , and meaningless and free . i miss the primitive confusions , and the secret way things came to me each evening , and the pain . i still wonder where the tears went , standing in my room each day and quietly inhabiting a calm , suspended state enveloped by the emptiness that scares and thrills me , with the background noise cascading out of nothing like a song that makes the days go by , a song incorporating everything — not into what it says , but simply in the way it touches me , a single image of dispersal , the inexhaustible perception of contingency and transience and isolation . it brings them back to me . i have the inwardness i think i must have wanted , and the quietude , the solitary temper , and this space where i can linger with the silence curling all around me like the sound of pure passage , waiting here surrounded by the furniture , the books and lists and all these other emblems of the floating world , the prints of raindrops that begin as mist , that fall discreetly through the atmosphere , and disappear . and then i feel them in the air , in a reserved , more earthly music filled with voices reassembling in a wellspring of remembrance , talking to me again , and finding shelter in the same evasive movements i can feel in my own life , cloaked in a quiet dignity that keeps away the dread of getting old , and fading out of other people’s consciousness , and dying – with its deepest insecurities and fears concealed by their own protective colorations , as the mind secretes its shell and calls it home . it has the texture of an uncreated substance , hovering between the settings it had come to love and some unformulated state i can’t imagine — waiting for the telephone to ring , obsessed with ways to occupy these wide , unstructured hours , and playing records by myself , and waking up alone . all things are disparate , yet subject to the same intense , eradicating wills of time and personality , like waves demolishing the walls love seemed to build between our lives and emptiness , the certainty they seemed to have just two or three short years ago , before the anger spread its poison over everything . i think about the way our visions locked together in a nightmare play of nervousness and language , living day to day inside the concentrated force of that relentless argument , whose words swept over us in formless torrents of anxiety , two people clinging to their versions of their lives almost like children — living out each other’s intermittent fantasies , that fed upon themselves as though infected by some vile , concentrated hatred ; who then woke up and planned that evening’s dinner . it’s all memories now , and distance . miles away the cat is sleeping on the driveway , john’s in school , and sunlight filters through a curtain in the kitchen . nothing really changes — the external world intrudes and then withdraws , and then becomes continuous again . i went downtown today and got a lamp with pendant lanterns made of opalescent art glass — part , i guess , of what this morning’s paper called the “ wright craze . ” i like the easy way the days go by , the parts of aging that have come to seem familiar , and the uneventful calm that seems to settle on the house at night . each morning brings the mirror’s reassuring face , as though the years had left the same enduring person simplified and changed — no longer vaguely desperate , no longer torn , yet still impatient with himself and still restless ; but drained of intricacy and rage , like a mild paradox — uninteresting in its own right , yet existing for the sake of something stranger . now and then our life comes over me , in brief , involuntary glimpses of that world that blossom unexpectedly , in fleeting moments of regret that come before the ache , the pang that gathers sharply , like an indrawn breath — a strange and thoughtful kind of pain , as though a steel band had somehow snapped inside my heart . i don’t know . but what i do know is that none of it is ever going to come to me again . why did i think a person only distantly like me might finally represent my life ? what aspects of my attitudes , my cast of mind , my inconclusive way of tossing questions at the world had i supposed might realize another person’s fantasies and turn her into someone else — who gradually became a separate part of me , and argued with the very words i would have used , and looked at me through eyes i’d looked at as though gazing at myself ? i guess we only realize ourselves in dreams , or in these self - reflexive reveries sustaining all the charms that contemplation holds — until the long enchantment of the soul with what it sees is lifted , and it startles at a space alight with objects of its infantile gaze , like people in a mall . i saw her just the other day . i felt a kind of comfort at her face , one tinctured with bemusement at the strange and guarded person she’d become — attractive , vaguely friendly , brisk ( too brisk ) , but no one i could think might represent my life . why did i even try to see myself in what’s outside ? the strangeness pushes it away , propels the vision back upon itself , into these regions filled with shapes that i can wander through and never see , as though their image were inherently unreal . the houses on a street , the quiet backyard shade , the room restored to life with bric - a - brac — i started by revisiting these things , then slowly reconceiving them as forms of loss made visible that balanced sympathy and space inside an abstract edifice combining reaches of the past with all these speculations , all this artful preening of the heart . i sit here at my desk , perplexed and puzzled , teasing out a tangled skein of years we wove together , and trying to combine the fragments of those years into a poem . who cares if life — if someone’s actual life — is finally insignificant and small ? there’s still a splendor in the way it flowers once and fades and leaves a carapace behind . there isn’t time to linger over why it happened , or attempt to make its mystery come to life again and last , like someone still embracing the confused perceptions of himself embedded in the past , as though eternity lay there — for heaven’s a delusion , and eternity is in the details , and this tiny , insubstantial life is all there is . — and that would be enough , but for the reoccurring dreams i often have of you . sometimes at night the banished unrealities return , as though a room suffused with light and poetry took shape around me . pictures line the walls . it’s early summer . somewhere in remembrance of thingspast , marcel , reflecting on his years with “ albertine ” — with x — suggests that love is just a consciousness of distance , of the separation of two lives in time and space . i think the same estrangement’s mirrored in each life , in how it seems both adequate and incomplete — part day - to - day existence , part imaginary construct beckoning at night , and sighing through my dreams like some disconsolate chimera , or the subject of a lonely , terrifying sadness ; or the isolation of a quiet winter evening , when the house feels empty , and silence intervenes . but in the wonderful enclosure opening in my heart , i seem to recognize our voices lilting in the yard , inflected by the rhythms of a song whose words are seamless and whose lines are never - ending . i can almost see the contours of your face , and sense the presence of the trees , and reimagine all of us together in a deep , abiding happiness , as if the three of us inhabited a fragile , made - up world that seemed to be so permanent , so real . i have this fantasy : it’s early in the evening . you and i are sitting in the backyard , talking . friends arrive , then drinks and dinner , conversation … the lovely summer twilight lasts forever … what’s the use ? what purpose do these speculations serve ? what mild enchantments do these meditations leave ? they’re just the murmurs of an age , of middle age , that help to pass the time that they retrieve before subsiding , leaving everything unchanged . each of us at times has felt the future fade , or seen the compass of his life diminished , or realized some tangible illusion was unreal . driving down to evanston last week , i suddenly remembered driving down that road eight years ago , so caught up in some story i’d just finished that i’d missed the way the countryside was changing — how in place of trees there now were office towers and theme parks , parts of a confusingly panoply of barns and discount malls transfiguring a landscape filled with high , receding clouds and rows of flimsy houses in what used to be a field . i thought of other people’s lives , and how impossible it seemed to grasp them on the model of my own — as little mirrors of infinity — or sense their forms of happiness , or in their minor personal upheavals feel the sweep of time reduced to human scale and see its abstract argument made visible . i thought of overarching dreams of plenitude — how life lacks shape until it’s given one by love , and how each soul is both a kingdom in itself and part of some incorporating whole that feels and has a face and lets it live forever . all of these seemed true , and cancelled one another , leaving just the feeling of an unseen presence tracing out the contours of a world erased , like music tracing out the contours of the mind — for life has the form of a winding curve in space and in its wake the human figure disappears . look at our surroundings — where a previous age could visualize a landscape we see borders , yet i think the underlying vision is the same : a person positing a world that he can see and can’t contain , and vexed by other people . everything is possible ; some of it seemed real or nearly real , yet in the end it spoke to me alone , in phrases echoing the isolation of a meager ledge above a waterfall , or rolling across a vast , expanding plain on which there’s always room , but only room for one . it starts and ends inside an ordinary room , while in the interim brimming with illusions , filled with commonplace delights that make the days go by , with simple arguments and fears , and with the nervous inkling of some vague , utopian conceit transforming both the landscape and our lives , until we look around and find ourselves at home , but in a wholly different world . and even those catastrophes that seemed to alter everything seem fleeting , grounded in a natural order all of us are subject to , and ought to celebrate . — yet why ? that things are temporary doesn’t render them unreal , unworthy of regretting . it’s not as though the past had never happened : all those years were real , and their loss was real , and it is sad — i don’t know what else to call it . i’m glad that both of us seem happy . yet what troubles me is just the way what used to be a world turned out , in retrospect , to be a state of mind , and no more tangible than that . and now it’s gone , and in its place i find the image of a process of inexorable decay , or of some great unraveling that drags the houses forward into emptiness and backwards into pictures of the intervening days love pieced together out of nothing . and i’m certain that this austere vision finally is true , and yet it strikes me as too meager to believe . it comes from much too high above the world and seems to me too hopeless , too extreme — but then i found myself one winter afternoon remembering a quiet morning in a classroom and inventing everything again , in ordinary terms that seemed to comprehend a childish dream of love , and then the loss of love , and all the intricate years between .

"all my life i had been forced by my parents to do taekwondo , a martial art , it is how i met so many of my 'friends' . i have always been miserable in it , i never had a choice in whether i get to stop , i only just got to quit this year . i was always cutting weight , berated by my coaches / teamates , and guilted in this sport . i hated the sport and myself , i hated cutting weight all the time , i was going to tournament after tournament constsntly cutting weight . tge strict diets never helped , i had the shittiest self control , and i always paid for it . having to starve myself , train harder , wear massive layers , all just to cut a couple of pounds to sometimes 10 pounds within a day . i always hated the sport ever since i went competitive , but i fucking despised it in high school . so much shit going on at once , and my parents were not helpful in the slightest . i got yelled at in 9th grade for trying to kill myself . that is when thr guilt tripping started . my parents would have something to keep me in the sport . "" think about all the money we spent , your coach and teamates need you , what would you do without this sport ? "" i did not want to be a taekwondo athlete , i wanted to figure out what i wanted . the people i met through taekwondo , were not the people i thought i knew . i considered these people to be family , but that was my fault . i neglected friends from school because i believed that i already had friends . but ehat i failed to realize , was that i only ever saw these people when taekwondo was involved , or our parents were involved . other than that i was near invisible to them . i only now learned this was the case . when i finally got a smart phone and social media , i was excited to talk to them again . things did not go as expected and i was left wondering why nobody cared . i thought maybe if i just disappeared or finally spoke up about how i felt , id finally get people to say something . nobody noticed . i know it sounds stupid for getting mad at people on social media , but i had no other way of talking to these people . there were a few people wh talked to me . but it was solely to keep me from committing suicide . i had opened up to her and told her how shitty everything has been , i told her how my parents would fight and how i wanted to die constantly . she was nice enough to listen . if i knew that she was just talking to me out of kindness and pity i wouldve never opened up . i did not want to be a burden to her or anyone . this year i was finally able to quit . it was not as relieving as i had hoped . i am not proud of what i did to get my parents to listen . i had a mental breakdown and threatened to kill myself or them . i hate that it worked , i just wanted them to listen to me . all these years of telling them i hated the sport and that it made me depressed , and they finally listened . it was not even satisfying , ill always be the kid who cried and screamed in order to get what he wanted . i have never felt so pathetic in my life . leaving taekwondo also meant leaving behind the only talented and interesting part of me . taekwondo was supposed to make up for my shitty grades , but i quit in the most importabt yeat , what colleges look at the most . as of now i have no talents or skills that make me even remotely interesting , and i am failing all my classes . i have been such a waste of money , effort and time . i stopped believing in god too . i do not have anything to bank my hopes on . i have nothing to believe in , nothing to hope for . at this point death seems so freeing , not just for me , but for everyone i have caused grief for . all the worry i put my parents and the people who have listened to me through , all the time i have wasted , all the money that would be wasted on me , it would all be fixed if i just ceased . dying just seems so perfect , my unjustified hate to people who were not my friends would vanish , my resentment to my parents for all the grief they put me through would vanish . sure people would be sad , but in the end i would be "" that kid we used to do taekwondo with "" . people keep telling me that my thoughts and feelings are common and not to feel alone , but tbh i just feel like i am a waste of time and effort that should be going to actual people in need . sorry for any spelling errors idrc . i am on mobile",1,,,1402

"the last time i saw father alive he was using a black umbrella , closed , to beat off some pigeons hanging outside the marble portals of a museum . we were visitors , walking very slowly , so father could stoop and examine everything . we had not been in the museum , but were resting on its steps . we saw it all — the fountains , the statues , the parks and the post office . cities are made of such things . once we encountered a wedding coming out of the cathedral and were caught in a shower of rice ; as the bride flicked her veiled head father licked his little finger and in this way saved a grain . on the next block he announced he was going to heaven . but first let’s go back to the hotel and rest , he said : i want my mint . those were practically his last words . and what did i want more than anything in the world ? probably the ancient polish recipe for blood soup , which was finally told to me in an empty deli in a deserted mill town in western massachusetts by the owner’s mother , who was alone one day when i burst in and demanded a bowl . but , she said , lacing her fingers around a jar of morello cherries , it requires one cup of new blood drawn from the goose whose neck you’ve just wrung to put in the pot , and where in these days can i find anything as fresh as that ? i had lost track of my life before , but nothing prepared me for the onslaught of wayfarer’s bliss when she continued to list , one by one , the impossible ingredients i needed to live . we sat at the greasy table far into the night , while snow fell on the locked doors of the church next door , dedicated to st . stanislas , which was rumored to be beautiful inside , and contain the remains of his beloved head .

i really do not know what else to say . i am forever broken and love my wife and kids too much too put them through anymore . i am truly beyond help no matter how much positive reinforcement i get from the ones i love but they really do not get the internal sadness and regret of what i could of and should have done but did not on many occasions throughout my life that most likely would have prevented all of this . it truly hurts because i just want to be the person i used to be but it will never happen . i do not want to be medicated at this point in my life as i know it will fail . i have been on meds before for about 8 years and been off of them for 12 it really did not help and i was actually better these last 12 years until these last few months . i was once a highly functional hard working husbands and father who never thought i would be posting something like this on reddit and i mean that with no offense . i am truly broken and hopeless . ,1,,,2246

"st . agnes' eve — ah , bitter chill it was ! the owl , for all his feathers , was a - cold ; the hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass , and silent was the flock in woolly fold : numb were the beadsman's fingers , while he told his rosary , and while his frosted breath , like pious incense from a censer old , seem'd taking flight for heaven , without a death , past the sweet virgin's picture , while his prayer he saith . his prayer he saith , this patient , holy man ; then takes his lamp , and riseth from his knees , and back returneth , meagre , barefoot , wan , along the chapel aisle by slow degrees : the sculptur'd dead , on each side , seem to freeze , emprison'd in black , purgatorial rails : knights , ladies , praying in dumb orat'ries , he passeth by ; and his weak spirit fails to think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails . northward he turneth through a little door , and scarce three steps , ere music's golden tongue flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor ; but no — already had his deathbell rung ; the joys of all his life were said and sung : his was harsh penance on st . agnes' eve : another way he went , and soon among rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve , and all night kept awake , for sinners' sake to grieve . that ancient beadsman heard the prelude soft ; and so it chanc'd , for many a door was wide , from hurry to and fro . soon , up aloft , the silver , snarling trumpets 'gan to chide : the level chambers , ready with their pride , were glowing to receive a thousand guests : the carved angels , ever eager - eyed , star'd , where upon their heads the cornice rests , with hair blown back , and wings put cross - wise on their breasts . at length burst in the argent revelry , with plume , tiara , and all rich array , numerous as shadows haunting faerily the brain , new stuff'd , in youth , with triumphs gay of old romance . these let us wish away , and turn , sole - thoughted , to one lady there , whose heart had brooded , all that wintry day , on love , and wing'd st . agnes' saintly care , as she had heard old dames full many times declare . they told her how , upon st . agnes' eve , young virgins might have visions of delight , and soft adorings from their loves receive upon the honey'd middle of the night , if ceremonies due they did aright ; as , supperless to bed they must retire , and couch supine their beauties , lily white ; nor look behind , nor sideways , but require of heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire . full of this whim was thoughtful madeline : the music , yearning like a god in pain , she scarcely heard : her maiden eyes divine , fix'd on the floor , saw many a sweeping train pass by — she heeded not at all : in vain came many a tiptoe , amorous cavalier , and back retir'd ; not cool'd by high disdain , but she saw not : her heart was otherwhere : she sigh'd for agnes' dreams , the sweetest of the year . she danc'd along with vague , regardless eyes , anxious her lips , her breathing quick and short : the hallow'd hour was near at hand : she sighs amid the timbrels , and the throng'd resort of whisperers in anger , or in sport ; 'mid looks of love , defiance , hate , and scorn , hoodwink'd with faery fancy ; all amort , save to st . agnes and her lambs unshorn , and all the bliss to be before to - morrow morn . so , purposing each moment to retire , she linger'd still . meantime , across the moors , had come young porphyro , with heart on fire for madeline . beside the portal doors , buttress'd from moonlight , stands he , and implores all saints to give him sight of madeline , but for one moment in the tedious hours , that he might gaze and worship all unseen ; perchance speak , kneel , touch , kiss — in sooth such things have been . he ventures in : let no buzz'd whisper tell : all eyes be muffled , or a hundred swords will storm his heart , love's fev'rous citadel : for him , those chambers held barbarian hordes , hyena foemen , and hot - blooded lords , whose very dogs would execrations howl against his lineage : not one breast affords him any mercy , in that mansion foul , save one old beldame , weak in body and in soul . ah , happy chance ! the aged creature came , shuffling along with ivory - headed wand , to where he stood , hid from the torch's flame , behind a broad half - pillar , far beyond the sound of merriment and chorus bland : he startled her ; but soon she knew his face , and grasp'd his fingers in her palsied hand , saying , "" mercy , porphyro ! hie thee from this place ; they are all here to - night , the whole blood - thirsty race ! "" get hence ! get hence ! there is dwarfish hildebrand ; he had a fever late , and in the fit he cursed thee and thine , both house and land : then there is that old lord maurice , not a whit more tame for his gray hairs — alas me ! flit ! flit like a ghost away . "" — "" ah , gossip dear , we're safe enough ; here in this arm - chair sit , and tell me how "" — "" good saints ! not here , not here ; follow me , child , or else these stones will be thy bier . "" he follow'd through a lowly arched way , brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume , and as she mutter'd "" well - a — well - a - day ! "" he found him in a little moonlight room , pale , lattic'd , chill , and silent as a tomb . "" now tell me where is madeline , "" said he , "" o tell me , angela , by the holy loom which none but secret sisterhood may see , when they st . agnes' wool are weaving piously . "" "" st . agnes ! ah ! it is st . agnes' eve — yet men will murder upon holy days : thou must hold water in a witch's sieve , and be liege - lord of all the elves and fays , to venture so : it fills me with amaze to see thee , porphyro ! — st . agnes' eve ! god's help ! my lady fair the conjuror plays this very night : good angels her deceive ! but let me laugh awhile , i have mickle time to grieve . "" feebly she laugheth in the languid moon , while porphyro upon her face doth look , like puzzled urchin on an aged crone who keepeth clos'd a wond'rous riddle - book , as spectacled she sits in chimney nook . but soon his eyes grew brilliant , when she told his lady's purpose ; and he scarce could brook tears , at the thought of those enchantments cold , and madeline asleep in lap of legends old . sudden a thought came like a full - blown rose , flushing his brow , and in his pained heart made purple riot : then doth he propose a stratagem , that makes the beldame start : "" a cruel man and impious thou art : sweet lady , let her pray , and sleep , and dream alone with her good angels , far apart from wicked men like thee . go , go ! — i deem thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem . "" "" i will not harm her , by all saints i swear , "" quoth porphyro : "" o may i ne'er find grace when my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer , if one of her soft ringlets i displace , or look with ruffian passion in her face : good angela , believe me by these tears ; or i will , even in a moment's space , awake , with horrid shout , my foemen's ears , and beard them , though they be more fang'd than wolves and bears . "" "" ah ! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul ? a poor , weak , palsy - stricken , churchyard thing , whose passing - bell may ere the midnight toll ; whose prayers for thee , each morn and evening , were never miss'd . "" — thus plaining , doth she bring a gentler speech from burning porphyro ; so woful , and of such deep sorrowing , that angela gives promise she will do whatever he shall wish , betide her weal or woe . which was , to lead him , in close secrecy , even to madeline's chamber , and there hide him in a closet , of such privacy that he might see her beauty unespy'd , and win perhaps that night a peerless bride , while legion'd faeries pac'd the coverlet , and pale enchantment held her sleepy - ey'd . never on such a night have lovers met , since merlin paid his demon all the monstrous debt . "" it shall be as thou wishest , "" said the dame : "" all cates and dainties shall be stored there quickly on this feast - night : by the tambour frame her own lute thou wilt see : no time to spare , for i am slow and feeble , and scarce dare on such a catering trust my dizzy head . wait here , my child , with patience ; kneel in prayer the while : ah ! thou must needs the lady wed , or may i never leave my grave among the dead . "" so saying , she hobbled off with busy fear . the lover's endless minutes slowly pass'd ; the dame return'd , and whisper'd in his ear to follow her ; with aged eyes aghast from fright of dim espial . safe at last , through many a dusky gallery , they gain the maiden's chamber , silken , hush'd , and chaste ; where porphyro took covert , pleas'd amain . his poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain . her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade , old angela was feeling for the stair , when madeline , st . agnes' charmed maid , rose , like a mission'd spirit , unaware : with silver taper's light , and pious care , she turn'd , and down the aged gossip led to a safe level matting . now prepare , young porphyro , for gazing on that bed ; she comes , she comes again , like ring - dove fray'd and fled . out went the taper as she hurried in ; its little smoke , in pallid moonshine , died : she clos'd the door , she panted , all akin to spirits of the air , and visions wide : no uttered syllable , or , woe betide ! but to her heart , her heart was voluble , paining with eloquence her balmy side ; as though a tongueless nightingale should swell her throat in vain , and die , heart - stifled , in her dell . a casement high and triple - arch'd there was , all garlanded with carven imag'ries of fruits , and flowers , and bunches of knot - grass , and diamonded with panes of quaint device , innumerable of stains and splendid dyes , as are the tiger - moth's deep - damask'd wings ; and in the midst , 'mong thousand heraldries , and twilight saints , and dim emblazonings , a shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings . full on this casement shone the wintry moon , and threw warm gules on madeline's fair breast , as down she knelt for heaven's grace and boon ; rose - bloom fell on her hands , together prest , and on her silver cross soft amethyst , and on her hair a glory , like a saint : she seem'd a splendid angel , newly drest , save wings , for heaven : — porphyro grew faint : she knelt , so pure a thing , so free from mortal taint . anon his heart revives : her vespers done , of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees ; unclasps her warmed jewels one by one ; loosens her fragrant boddice ; by degrees her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees : half - hidden , like a mermaid in sea - weed , pensive awhile she dreams awake , and sees , in fancy , fair st . agnes in her bed , but dares not look behind , or all the charm is fled . soon , trembling in her soft and chilly nest , in sort of wakeful swoon , perplex'd she lay , until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd her soothed limbs , and soul fatigued away ; flown , like a thought , until the morrow - day ; blissfully haven'd both from joy and pain ; clasp'd like a missal where swart paynims pray ; blinded alike from sunshine and from rain , as though a rose should shut , and be a bud again . stol'n to this paradise , and so entranced , porphyro gaz'd upon her empty dress , and listen'd to her breathing , if it chanced to wake into a slumberous tenderness ; which when he heard , that minute did he bless , and breath'd himself : then from the closet crept , noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness , and over the hush'd carpet , silent , stept , and 'tween the curtains peep'd , where , lo ! — how fast she slept . then by the bed - side , where the faded moon made a dim , silver twilight , soft he set a table , and , half anguish'd , threw thereon a cloth of woven crimson , gold , and jet : — o for some drowsy morphean amulet ! the boisterous , midnight , festive clarion , the kettle - drum , and far - heard clarinet , affray his ears , though but in dying tone : — the hall door shuts again , and all the noise is gone . and still she slept an azure - lidded sleep , in blanched linen , smooth , and lavender'd , while he forth from the closet brought a heap of candied apple , quince , and plum , and gourd ; with jellies soother than the creamy curd , and lucent syrops , tinct with cinnamon ; manna and dates , in argosy transferr'd from fez ; and spiced dainties , every one , from silken samarcand to cedar'd lebanon . these delicates he heap'd with glowing hand on golden dishes and in baskets bright of wreathed silver : sumptuous they stand in the retired quiet of the night , filling the chilly room with perfume light . — "" and now , my love , my seraph fair , awake ! thou art my heaven , and i thine eremite : open thine eyes , for meek st . agnes' sake , or i shall drowse beside thee , so my soul doth ache . "" thus whispering , his warm , unnerved arm sank in her pillow . shaded was her dream by the dusk curtains : — 'twas a midnight charm impossible to melt as iced stream : the lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam ; broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies : it seem'd he never , never could redeem from such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes ; so mus'd awhile , entoil'd in woofed phantasies . awakening up , he took her hollow lute , — tumultuous , — and , in chords that tenderest be , he play'd an ancient ditty , long since mute , in provence call'd , "" la belle dame sans mercy "" : close to her ear touching the melody ; — wherewith disturb'd , she utter'd a soft moan : he ceas'd — she panted quick — and suddenly her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone : upon his knees he sank , pale as smooth - sculptured stone . her eyes were open , but she still beheld , now wide awake , the vision of her sleep : there was a painful change , that nigh expell'd the blisses of her dream so pure and deep at which fair madeline began to weep , and moan forth witless words with many a sigh ; while still her gaze on porphyro would keep ; who knelt , with joined hands and piteous eye , fearing to move or speak , she look'd so dreamingly . "" ah , porphyro ! "" said she , "" but even now thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear , made tuneable with every sweetest vow ; and those sad eyes were spiritual and clear : how chang'd thou art ! how pallid , chill , and drear ! give me that voice again , my porphyro , those looks immortal , those complainings dear ! oh leave me not in this eternal woe , for if thy diest , my love , i know not where to go . "" beyond a mortal man impassion'd far at these voluptuous accents , he arose ethereal , flush'd , and like a throbbing star seen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose ; into her dream he melted , as the rose blendeth its odour with the violet , — solution sweet : meantime the frost - wind blows like love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet against the window - panes ; st . agnes' moon hath set . 'tis dark : quick pattereth the flaw - blown sleet : "" this is no dream , my bride , my madeline !

"" she hurried at his words , beset with fears , for there were sleeping dragons all around , at glaring watch , perhaps , with ready spears — down the wide stairs a darkling way they found . — in all the house was heard no human sound . a chain - droop'd lamp was flickering by each door ; the arras , rich with horseman , hawk , and hound , flutter'd in the besieging wind's uproar ; and the long carpets rose along the gusty floor . they glide , like phantoms , into the wide hall ; like phantoms , to the iron porch , they glide ; where lay the porter , in uneasy sprawl , with a huge empty flaggon by his side : the wakeful bloodhound rose , and shook his hide , but his sagacious eye an inmate owns : by one , and one , the bolts full easy slide : — the chains lie silent on the footworn stones ; — the key turns , and the door upon its hinges groans . and they are gone : ay , ages long ago these lovers fled away into the storm . that night the baron dreamt of many a woe , and all his warrior - guests , with shade and form of witch , and demon , and large coffin - worm , were long be - nightmar'd . angela the old died palsy - twitch'd , with meagre face deform ; the beadsman , after thousand aves told , for aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold .

"for peter orr when all the rooms of the house fill with smoke , it’s not enough to say an angel is sleeping on the chimney . 1 . a night in the barn the deer carcass hangs from a rafter . wrapped in blankets , a boy keeps watch from a pile of loose hay . then he sleeps and dreams about a death that is coming : inside him , there are small bones scattered in a field among burdocks and dead grass . he will spend his life walking there , gathering the bones together . pigeons rustle in the eaves . at his feet , the german shepherd snaps its jaws in its sleep . 2 a father and his four sons run down a slope toward a deer they just killed . the father and two sons carry rifles . they laugh , jostle , and chatter together . a gun goes off and the youngest brother falls to the ground . a boy with a rifle stands beside him , screaming . 3 i crouch in the corner of my room , staring into the glass well of my hands ; far down i see him drowning in air . outside , leaves shaped like mouths make a black pool under a tree . snails glide there , little death - swans . 4 . smoke something has covered the chimney and the whole house fills with smoke . i go outside and look up at the roof , but i can’t see anything . i go back inside . everyone weeps , walking from room to room . their eyes ache . this smoke turns people into shadows . even after it is gone and the tears are gone , we will smell it in pillows when we lie down to sleep . 5 he lives in a house of black glass . sometimes i visit him , and we talk . my father says he is dead , but what does that mean ? last night i found a child sleeping on a nest of bones . he had a red , leaf - shaped scar on his cheek . i lifted him up and carried him with me , though i didn’t know where i was going . 6 . the journey each night , i knelt on a marble slab and scrubbed at the blood . i scrubbed for years and still it was there . but tonight the bones in my feet begin to burn . i stand up and start walking , and the slab appears under my feet with each step , a white road only as long as your body . 7 . the distance the winter i was eight , a horse slipped on the ice , breaking its leg . father took a rifle , a can of gasoline . i stood by the road at dusk and watched the carcass burning in the far pasture . i was twelve when i killed him ; i felt my own bones wrench from my body . now i am twenty - seven and walk beside this river , looking for them . they have become a bridge that arches toward the other shore .

"i he did not wear his scarlet coat , for blood and wine are red , and blood and wine were on his hands when they found him with the dead , the poor dead woman whom he loved , and murdered in her bed . he walked amongst the trial men in a suit of shabby gray ; a cricket cap was on his head , and his step seemed light and gay ; but i never saw a man who looked so wistfully at the day . i never saw a man who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue which prisoners call the sky , and at every drifting cloud that went with sails of silver by . i walked , with other souls in pain , within another ring , and was wondering if the man had done a great or little thing , when a voice behind me whispered low , "" that fellow's got to swing . "" dear christ ! the very prison walls suddenly seemed to reel , and the sky above my head became like a casque of scorching steel ; and , though i was a soul in pain , my pain i could not feel . i only knew what hunted thought quickened his step , and why he looked upon the garish day with such a wistful eye ; the man had killed the thing he loved , and so he had to die . yet each man kills the thing he loves , by each let this be heard , some do it with a bitter look , some with a flattering word , the coward does it with a kiss , the brave man with a sword ! some kill their love when they are young , and some when they are old ; some strangle with the hands of lust , some with the hands of gold : the kindest use a knife , because the dead so soon grow cold . some love too little , some too long , some sell , and others buy ; some do the deed with many tears , and some without a sigh : for each man kills the thing he loves , yet each man does not die . he does not die a death of shame on a day of dark disgrace , nor have a noose about his neck , nor a cloth upon his face , nor drop feet foremost through the floor into an empty space . he does not sit with silent men who watch him night and day ; who watch him when he tries to weep , and when he tries to pray ; who watch him lest himself should rob the prison of its prey . he does not wake at dawn to see dread figures throng his room , the shivering chaplain robed in white , the sheriff stern with gloom , and the governor all in shiny black , with the yellow face of doom . he does not rise in piteous haste to put on convict - clothes , while some coarse - mouthed doctor gloats , and notes each new and nerve - twitched pose , fingering a watch whose little ticks are like horrible hammer - blows . he does not know that sickening thirst that sands one's throat , before the hangman with his gardener's gloves slips through the padded door , and binds one with three leathern thongs , that the throat may thirst no more . he does not bend his head to hear the burial office read , nor while the terror of his soul tells him he is not dead , cross his own coffin , as he moves into the hideous shed . he does not stare upon the air through a little roof of glass : he does not pray with lips of clay for his agony to pass ; nor feel upon his shuddering cheek the kiss of caiaphas . ii six weeks the guardsman walked the yard , in the suit of shabby gray : his cricket cap was on his head , and his step seemed light and gay , but i never saw a man who looked so wistfully at the day . i never saw a man who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue which prisoners call the sky , and at every wandering cloud that trailed its ravelled fleeces by . he did not wring his hands , as do those witless men who dare to try to rear the changeling hope in the cave of black despair : he only looked upon the sun , and drank the morning air . he did not wring his hands nor weep , nor did he peek or pine , but he drank the air as though it held some healthful anodyne ; with open mouth he drank the sun as though it had been wine ! and i and all the souls in pain , who tramped the other ring , forgot if we ourselves had done a great or little thing , and watched with gaze of dull amaze the man who had to swing . for strange it was to see him pass with a step so light and gay , and strange it was to see him look so wistfully at the day , and strange it was to think that he had such a debt to pay . for oak and elm have pleasant leaves that in the spring - time shoot : but grim to see is the gallows - tree , with its alder - bitten root , and , green or dry , a man must die before it bears its fruit ! the loftiest place is that seat of grace for which all worldlings try : but who would stand in hempen band upon a scaffold high , and through a murderer's collar take his last look at the sky ? it is sweet to dance to violins when love and life are fair : to dance to flutes , to dance to lutes is delicate and rare : but it is not sweet with nimble feet to dance upon the air ! so with curious eyes and sick surmise we watched him day by day , and wondered if each one of us would end the self - same way , for none can tell to what red hell his sightless soul may stray . at last the dead man walked no more amongst the trial men , and i knew that he was standing up in the black dock's dreadful pen , and that never would i see his face in god's sweet world again . like two doomed ships that pass in storm we had crossed each other's way : but we made no sign , we said no word , we had no word to say ; for we did not meet in the holy night , but in the shameful day . a prison wall was round us both , two outcast men we were : the world had thrust us from its heart , and god from out his care : and the iron gin that waits for sin had caught us in its snare . iii in debtors' yard the stones are hard , and the dripping wall is high , so it was there he took the air beneath the leaden sky , and by each side a warder walked , for fear the man might die . or else he sat with those who watched his anguish night and day ; who watched him when he rose to weep , and when he crouched to pray ; who watched him lest himself should rob their scaffold of its prey . the governor was strong upon the regulations act : the doctor said that death was but a scientific fact : and twice a day the chaplain called , and left a little tract . and twice a day he smoked his pipe , and drank his quart of beer : his soul was resolute , and held no hiding - place for fear ; he often said that he was glad the hangman's hands were near . but why he said so strange a thing no warder dared to ask : for he to whom a watcher's doom is given as his task , must set a lock upon his lips , and make his face a mask . or else he might be moved , and try to comfort or console : and what should human pity do pent up in murderer's hole ? what word of grace in such a place could help a brother's soul ? with slouch and swing around the ring we trod the fools' parade ! we did not care : we knew we were the devil's own brigade : and shaven head and feet of lead make a merry masquerade . we tore the tarry rope to shreds with blunt and bleeding nails ; we rubbed the doors , and scrubbed the floors , and cleaned the shining rails : and , rank by rank , we soaped the plank , and clattered with the pails . we sewed the sacks , we broke the stones , we turned the dusty drill : we banged the tins , and bawled the hymns , and sweated on the mill : but in the heart of every man terror was lying still . so still it lay that every day crawled like a weed - clogged wave : and we forgot the bitter lot that waits for fool and knave , till once , as we tramped in from work , we passed an open grave . with yawning mouth the yellow hole gaped for a living thing ; the very mud cried out for blood to the thirsty asphalte ring : and we knew that ere one dawn grew fair some prisoner had to swing . right in we went , with soul intent on death and dread and doom : the hangman , with his little bag , went shuffling through the gloom : and each man trembled as he crept into his numbered tomb . that night the empty corridors were full of forms of fear , and up and down the iron town stole feet we could not hear , and through the bars that hide the stars white faces seemed to peer . he lay as one who lies and dreams in a pleasant meadow - land , the watchers watched him as he slept , and could not understand how one could sleep so sweet a sleep with a hangman close at hand . but there is no sleep when men must weep who never yet have wept : so we — the fool , the fraud , the knave — that endless vigil kept , and through each brain on hands of pain another's terror crept . alas ! it is a fearful thing to feel another's guilt ! for , right within , the sword of sin pierced to its poisoned hilt , and as molten lead were the tears we shed for the blood we had not spilt . the warders with their shoes of felt crept by each padlocked door , and peeped and saw , with eyes of awe , gray figures on the floor , and wondered why men knelt to pray who never prayed before . all through the night we knelt and prayed , mad mourners of a corse ! the troubled plumes of midnight were the plumes upon a hearse : and bitter wine upon a sponge was the savour of remorse . the gray cock crew , the red cock crew , but never came the day : and crooked shapes of terror crouched , in the corners where we lay : and each evil sprite that walks by night before us seemed to play . they glided past , they glided fast , like travellers through a mist : they mocked the moon in a rigadoon of delicate turn and twist , and with formal pace and loathsome grace the phantoms kept their tryst . with mop and mow , we saw them go , slim shadows hand in hand : about , about , in ghostly rout they trod a saraband : and damned grotesques made arabesques , like the wind upon the sand ! with the pirouettes of marionettes , they tripped on pointed tread : but with flutes of fear they filled the ear , as their grisly masque they led , and loud they sang , and long they sang , for they sang to wake the dead . "" oho ! "" they cried , "" the world is wide , but fettered limbs go lame ! and once , or twice , to throw the dice is a gentlemanly game , but he does not win who plays with sin in the secret house of shame . "" no things of air these antics were , that frolicked with such glee : to men whose lives were held in gyves , and whose feet might not go free , ah ! wounds of christ ! they were living things , most terrible to see . around , around , they waltzed and wound ; some wheeled in smirking pairs ; with the mincing step of a demirep some sidled up the stairs : and with subtle sneer , and fawning leer , each helped us at our prayers . the morning wind began to moan , but still the night went on : through its giant loom the web of gloom crept till each thread was spun : and , as we prayed , we grew afraid of the justice of the sun . the moaning wind went wandering round the weeping prison - wall : till like a wheel of turning steel we felt the minutes crawl : o moaning wind ! what had we done to have such a seneschal ? at last i saw the shadowed bars , like a lattice wrought in lead , move right across the whitewashed wall that faced my three - plank bed , and i knew that somewhere in the world god's dreadful dawn was red . at six of the clock we cleaned our cells , at seven all was still , but the sough and swing of a mighty wing the prison seemed to fill , for the lord of death with icy breath had entered in to kill . he did not pass in purple pomp , nor ride a moon - white steed . three yards of cord and a sliding board are all the gallows' need : so with rope of shame the herald came to do the secret deed . we were as men who through a fen of filthy darkness grope : we did not dare to breathe a prayer , or to give our anguish scope : something was dead in each of us , and what was dead was hope . for man's grim justice goes its way and will not swerve aside : it slays the weak , it slays the strong , it has a deadly stride : with iron heel it slays the strong , the monstrous parricide ! we waited for the stroke of eight : each tongue was thick with thirst : for the stroke of eight is the stroke of fate that makes a man accursed , and fate will use a running noose for the best man and the worst . we had no other thing to do , save to wait for the sign to come : so , like things of stone in a valley lone , quiet we sat and dumb : but each man's heart beat thick and quick , like a madman on a drum ! with sudden shock the prison - clock smote on the shivering air , and from all the gaol rose up a wail of impotent despair , like the sound the frightened marshes hear from some leper in his lair . and as one sees most fearful things in the crystal of a dream , we saw the greasy hempen rope hooked to the blackened beam , and heard the prayer the hangman's snare strangled into a scream . and all the woe that moved him so that he gave that bitter cry , and the wild regrets , and the bloody sweats , none knew so well as i : for he who lives more lives than one more deaths than one must die . iv there is no chapel on the day on which they hang a man : the chaplain's heart is far too sick , or his face is far too wan , or there is that written in his eyes which none should look upon . so they kept us close till nigh on noon , and then they rang the bell , and the warders with their jingling keys opened each listening cell , and down the iron stair we tramped , each from his separate hell . out into god's sweet air we went , but not in wonted way , for this man's face was white with fear , and that man's face was gray , and i never saw sad men who looked so wistfully at the day . i never saw sad men who looked with such a wistful eye upon that little tent of blue we prisoners called the sky , and at every careless cloud that passed in happy freedom by . but there were those amongst us all who walked with downcast head , and knew that , had each got his due , they should have died instead : he had but killed a thing that lived , whilst they had killed the dead . for he who sins a second time wakes a dead soul to pain , and draws it from its spotted shroud , and makes it bleed again , and makes it bleed great gouts of blood , and makes it bleed in vain ! like ape or clown , in monstrous garb with crooked arrows starred , silently we went round and round the slippery asphalte yard ; silently we went round and round , and no man spoke a word . silently we went round and round , and through each hollow mind the memory of dreadful things rushed like a dreadful wind , and horror stalked before each man , and terror crept behind . the warders strutted up and down , and kept their herd of brutes , their uniforms were spick and span , and they wore their sunday suits , but we knew the work they had been at , by the quicklime on their boots . for where a grave had opened wide , there was no grave at all : only a stretch of mud and sand by the hideous prison - wall , and a little heap of burning lime , that the man should have his pall . for he has a pall , this wretched man , such as few men can claim : deep down below a prison - yard , naked for greater shame , he lies , with fetters on each foot , wrapt in a sheet of flame ! and all the while the burning lime eats flesh and bone away , it eats the brittle bone by night , and the soft flesh by day , it eats the flesh and bone by turns , but it eats the heart alway . for three long years they will not sow or root or seedling there : for three long years the unblessed spot will sterile be and bare , and look upon the wondering sky with unreproachful stare . they think a murderer's heart would taint each simple seed they sow . it is not true ! god's kindly earth is kindlier than men know , and the red rose would but glow more red , the white rose whiter blow . out of his mouth a red , red rose ! out of his heart a white ! for who can say by what strange way , christ brings his will to light , since the barren staff the pilgrim bore bloomed in the great pope's sight ? but neither milk - white rose nor red may bloom in prison air ; the shard , the pebble , and the flint , are what they give us there : for flowers have been known to heal a common man's despair . so never will wine - red rose or white , petal by petal , fall on that stretch of mud and sand that lies by the hideous prison - wall , to tell the men who tramp the yard that god's son died for all . yet though the hideous prison - wall still hems him round and round , and a spirit may not walk by night that is with fetters bound , and a spirit may but weep that lies in such unholy ground , he is at peace — this wretched man — at peace , or will be soon : there is no thing to make him mad , nor does terror walk at noon , for the lampless earth in which he lies has neither sun nor moon . they hanged him as a beast is hanged : they did not even toll a requiem that might have brought rest to his startled soul , but hurriedly they took him out , and hid him in a hole . they stripped him of his canvas clothes , and gave him to the flies : they mocked the swollen purple throat , and the stark and staring eyes : and with laughter loud they heaped the shroud in which their convict lies . the chaplain would not kneel to pray by his dishonoured grave : nor mark it with that blessed cross that christ for sinners gave , because the man was one of those whom christ came down to save . yet all is well ; he has but passed to life's appointed bourne : and alien tears will fill for him pity's long - broken urn , for his mourners will be outcast men , and outcasts always mourn . v i know not whether laws be right , or whether laws be wrong ; all that we know who lie in gaol is that the wall is strong ; and that each day is like a year , a year whose days are long . but this i know , that every law that men have made for man , since first man took his brother's life , and the sad world began , but straws the wheat and saves the chaff with a most evil fan . this too i know — and wise it were if each could know the same — that every prison that men build is built with bricks of shame , and bound with bars lest christ should see how men their brothers maim . with bars they blur the gracious moon , and blind the goodly sun : and they do well to hide their hell , for in it things are done that son of god nor son of man ever should look upon ! the vilest deeds like poison weeds bloom well in prison - air : it is only what is good in man that wastes and withers there : pale anguish keeps the heavy gate , and the warder is despair . for they starve the little frightened child till it weeps both night and day : and they scourge the weak , and flog the fool , and gibe the old and gray , and some grow mad , and all grow bad , and none a word may say . each narrow cell in which we dwell is a foul and dark latrine , and the fetid breath of living death chokes up each grated screen , and all , but lust , is turned to dust in humanity's machine . the brackish water that we drink creeps with a loathsome slime , and the bitter bread they weigh in scales is full of chalk and lime , and sleep will not lie down , but walks wild - eyed , and cries to time . but though lean hunger and green thirst like asp with adder fight , we have little care of prison fare , for what chills and kills outright is that every stone one lifts by day becomes one's heart by night . with midnight always in one's heart , and twilight in one's cell , we turn the crank , or tear the rope , each in his separate hell , and the silence is more awful far than the sound of a brazen bell . and never a human voice comes near to speak a gentle word : and the eye that watches through the door is pitiless and hard : and by all forgot , we rot and rot , with soul and body marred . and thus we rust life's iron chain degraded and alone : and some men curse , and some men weep , and some men make no moan : but god's eternal laws are kind and break the heart of stone . and every human heart that breaks , in prison - cell or yard , is as that broken box that gave its treasure to the lord , and filled the unclean leper's house with the scent of costliest nard . ah ! happy they whose hearts can break and peace of pardon win ! how else may man make straight his plan and cleanse his soul from sin ? how else but through a broken heart may lord christ enter in ? and he of the swollen purple throat , and the stark and staring eyes , waits for the holy hands that took the thief to paradise ; and a broken and a contrite heart the lord will not despise . the man in red who reads the law gave him three weeks of life , three little weeks in which to heal his soul of his soul's strife , and cleanse from every blot of blood the hand that held the knife . and with tears of blood he cleansed the hand , the hand that held the steel : for only blood can wipe out blood , and only tears can heal : and the crimson stain that was of cain became christ's snow - white seal . vi in reading gaol by reading town there is a pit of shame , and in it lies a wretched man eaten by teeth of flame , in a burning winding - sheet he lies , and his grave has got no name . and there , till christ call forth the dead , in silence let him lie : no need to waste the foolish tear , or heave the windy sigh : the man had killed the thing he loved , and so he had to die . and all men kill the thing they love , by all let this be heard , some do it with a bitter look , some with a flattering word , the coward does it with a kiss , the brave man with a sword .

"yep . that is the title . my house burned down a few weeks ago , although the cause of it has not been determined yet . the only info i know is that the fire started upstairs . so , me and my family have been airbnb and hotel hopping for a little bit . now that we have got the context out of the way , i would like to say why exactly i wanna die . there is a lot of reasons . i will bore people saying them all , so i will only say the big ones . me and my partner of almost 3 years had to break up with each other , because we did something we should not have . we wore forbidden to speak to each other for a while , but we disobeyed , feeling that the punishment was unfit for the stupid thing we did . now , we are unable to contact each other in any form , most likely forever . as i said previously , my house pretty much burned down . most everything was water damaged or smoke damaged from the water the firemen used to put out the fire ( little did i know , that shit's poisonous , cuz of chemistry and shit ) . our cookbooks , any art on the walls , our beds , our documents . . anything that was not perfectly safe was either damaged , or garunteed gone . both of my cats are dead , one from old age , and the other from a tumor , and internal bleeding . as hard as i try , i still cannot completely recover from my childhood trauma involving my school . it haunts me , triggering me in ways that seem like huge symptoms of cptsd . i grew up in a shitty neighborhood that people think is great from the outside , not knowing that it is not all rainbows and sunshine . i still have to deal with my transphobic mom , who still does not fully accept me after i began to transition almost a year ago . i have no friends here , and no nearby family aside from my parents where i live . all my friends , family , and pretty much my life are back in cali . the only way i can feel any emotion ( aside from emptyness ) now is either when i hear my parents arguing or fighting , or when i am listening to music . i feel like no one takes my problems seriously , i feel extremely lonely . i feel that no one would really put in the effort to stop me before things get worse , before i finally kill myself . if i do , it will be fucking beautiful . i find beauty in the wrong things , happiness in places that are not correct . i feel like a fractured piece of glass , but at the same time it feels like nothingness or maybe my position in hell as a demon would suit me better . the world is fucked . but , everyone already knows that . what no one seems to notice is that people sometimes need a fuck ton more help than they seem to . they try once , and then give up if it does not work . "" well , i tried . "" enough of that rambling though , i guess . i am constantly considering offing myself when i feel crushed , when i feel emotions again . i always need someone to scream to , to cry on their shoulder , to vent nonsense words to , and have them still care about me at all , to still have them not be freaked out by the thoughts i spit out . i do not trust people anymore . i still look over my shoulder . i still freeze up or tremble when i hear anything resembling gunshots . i cannot speak , i go mute when adults yell or shout at each other or at kids . i'm a kedamono . i'm a akuma . i call myself these things not because i really belive i physically am these things , but i call myself them because i associate myself with the terrible nature that they are commonly made up to be . i hate myself that much . i do not really know why i am writing this post . . but i hope that at least someone will listen . people might care about my mental issues for once . i know that i am not totally alone . i have got my dad and grandma , and i have got my internet friends . but things can only feel happy for so long , being so far away from 95 % of what i am . i feel like i should have walked upstairs , and burnt to my name . i wish i had burnt to ash , right then and there . i wish i had died in my burning home .

"this is going to be a long one , so buckle up . when i was 14 , my mom chose her abusive husband ( that she had known for 2 years ) over me . she sent me to live with my grandparents in another state because i was “ causing issues ” in her marriage . upon moving in with my grandparents , i started showing behavior issues due to the neglect and abuse that i had endured with my mother . my grandparents kicked me out a few months later . i moved in with my uncle’s new wife . my uncle was incarcerated at the time and i didn’t know his wife very well . my new aunt also had a daughter who was 12 . my aunt was more of a friend than a parental figure . i was allowed to do anything and everything i wanted . i had made a friend at school . only one . i was shy and awkward but this girl seemed to understand me and like me . on valentine’s day , we went to her boyfriend’s apartment . i didn’t know anything about him but that he had his own place and he was older . as a 14 year old , that seemed to be cool as fuck . once my friend and i got to her boyfriend’s apartment , i realized that it wasn’t just her boyfriend there . . . but 5 other grown adult men . they provided alcohol and cigarettes . i didn’t partake in either , but it was exciting at the time . my friend on the other hand had way too much to drink . she ended up in the bathroom with her boyfriend and eventually passed out . her boyfriend got scared and left his apartment . i was left alone with the other 5 men . they took turns sexually assaulting me . i don’t remember much else about the rest of that night . a few days later , i told my aunt and cousin what had happened to me . they went with me to the police station where i made a report . i didn’t remember many details and it had been long ago to do a rape kit . the next day , i’m sitting in my science class when two police officers walk in and tell my teacher that i need to go with them to the principals office . my stomach was in my throat the entire walk there . i thought i’d walk in there and my abusers would be there . i didn’t know what to think . when i got to the principals office , there laid all of my belongings . my aunt kicked me out . the police officers tell me i’m being taken to social services to be placed in foster care fast forward a few months . i had been in 6 homes at this point . none were a good fit due to my behavior ( aka my trauma ) . i get placed into my 7th home . i run away . my foster mom was mean and i was overly sensitive . long story short , i got in a car with a stranger who found me wandering looking lost as fuck by the mall . he sexually assaulted me as well . he kept me captive for 36 hours . my mom eventually came back and tried to get me out of foster care . i was going to go home on christmas as long as her parenting classes and everything went well . christmas day comes and she was nowhere to be found . she left me again . a few years go by . new home after new home . juvenile detention centers . group homes . i moved a total of 43 times . i age out of the foster system . my mom finally wanted me back . i’d finally be home . that was very short lived . my mom kicked me out after 3 months so she could move across the state to be with a new boyfriend . luckily , there was a law that foster children could return to the system within 6 months of aging out . i went back . i had no other option . i move in with a new family . i’m 18 now . i start trying to date people . due to me being so socially awkward , i used online dating websites . i met a guy . went to his house . was sexually assaulted . . again . my foster parents kicked me out . they did not want to be legally liable for what happened since they gave me permission to go there . they didn’t want their foster care license taken away . i eventually move in with a friend from high school . a few months later , i am sexually assaulted for the last time . another man i had met online . current - ish day : i married at 21 . 3 years later he cheated and chose another woman over me . i move across the country for a new start . i’m 24 now . i have a great job , i’m finally happy . i’m lonely , but happy . i meet someone new . we date for almost 2 years and he cheated and eventually attempted to kill me . i ended the relationship a few months after that happened and i filed a police report and a restraining order . i was successful in getting the restraining order granted but nothing ever came of the charges against him . most current : i get into another relationship several months later . i’ve been working on myself . i’ve been trying to be happy . i’ve been trying to let go of the past . i can’t . it’s turned me into such a controlling and unhappy person . i found someone who had loved me . somebody who wanted me forever and i let my trauma ruin our relationship . i accused him of cheating . i tried to slap him during an argument . i didn’t want him to go out with his friends out of fear that he would cheat on me or find someone better and leave me for them . i was mean to him and i would start fights with him over small things . the only person i have ever felt genuinely loved me left me two nights ago . he blocked me on everything today after telling me that i need to find someone else to be my support system . i’m probably going to jail for something i did months ago . my dad passed away a few days ago . i have to see the person who tried to kill me in court in five days . i’ve done nothing with my life . i’ve never been happy . i have no friends or family to call and cry to . i feel like i have nothing worth living for . i’m so tired of fighting for the will to live . i’m so tired of hurting",1,,,5941

"okay , this is a very long story . i had an average child hood , i was happy as a small child . around when i turned 9 , i had very strong urges to smoke my grandmothers cigarettes so i took them , and borrowed a lighter brought them behind the house and smoked , although , i did not inhale it . but even though there were 0 effects , i still felt a strong urge to continue doing it . i ultimately got caught , got a slap on the wrist cause i was nine . when i was twelve , i smoked weed for the first time . i smoked about 1 / 4 a gram , since i was stupid , my parents caught me once again . drug tested me with an otc drug test . i tested positive . so they took everything from me , put me in quite literal solitary confinement . i could not leave my room except to eat , go to school , and shower . i had books , and nothing else . and out of such profound boredom my desire to do drugs intensified , so i sneak out and smoke cigarettes , now aware of how to inhale them . i did not get caught immediately , but i got desperate , and started stealing from my mom , since she had started counting them , i was caught once more . she took away my books . it was a never ending cycle of me smoking , getting in more trouble , and being so bored , that i smoke again . finally , it kept happening so i got sent to a substance abuse rehab facility for juveniles . i was only there for a month , came back and i started having extreme troubles in school with social anxiety , i could not even hold up a conversation anymore . i had an awful 8th grade year , and towards the end , i get extremely depressed and i began abusing more drugs . this time , i was using dxm , dextromethorphan , i abused benadryl , i smoked weed , i huffed gasoline , hairspray , and i just kept doing shit and getting in trouble . we got to the same predicament , i was going to be sent away , although i finally got my shit together again . then , it happened again , and i got really depressed . because i was much older , and i realised how much my actions were hurting my mother and betraying my family time and time again and i was always turning right around and spitting in there faces i remember i went to my grandmothers house , and she let me watch tv because she was nice like that , but then i just kept hurting them , and lying , decieving , so i try to take my own life with tylenol , go to a mental hospital for 8 days , my mom , sympathetically ungrounds me , and i was gracious , i intended to make it right . butttt it happened again . more suicidal ideations , anndd baack to the hospital . i came back in a week , and had little to no problems , i had intensive in home counseling after i came back , and around a year later , i finally get rid of the counseling , my life was getting better , i was gaining back their trust , and i just had to go and do the shit again . and its all just hitting me at once the fact that i am a 14 year old that cannot be trusted to be unsupervised for 5 fucking minutes and every word that comes out of my mouth is a lie because i am afraid of telling people the truth and my damn mom who has done so much , she reached out to counselors , psychiatrists , bent over backwards to get me help that i desperately needed and i repay her by doing the same shit and i just cannot go on anymore i do not plan on it i am currently in a queue for lifeline chat , and i am having extreme suicidal urges",1,,,1926

"i'll preface this by saying that i do not think i actively want to kill myself . i have not actively wanted to for over a decade , since about six months after my lone serious attempt . at the same time , i can not . stop . thinking about it . i toss and turn all night , imagining myself dead , thinking about never waking up , thinking phrases like "" i want to die "" and "" { my name } is dead "" over and over on seemingly - endless loops , thinking about my husband having to notify people , imagining getting in car accidents or trees falling on the house and crushing me . i absolutely fucking hate it , and it is getting to the point where i catch myself thinking that maybe if i just went through with it at least these horrible nights would be over . i know that part of the problem is the times we are living in . my industry ( theatre ) effectively disappeared overnight . my non - work passion ( travel ) is cancelled . the world is on fire , people are dying by the thousands , and i cannot seem to stop myself from feeling all of it . when my brain is not directly bombarding me with thoughts of death , it is playing an endless loop of : "" you'll never set foot onstage again . you will never travel again . people are garbage and irredeemable and things will never get better . "" it does not matter whether these thoughts are rational or not - they * won't go away . * i feel like i am drowning . normally i would put myself back in therapy in a situation like this but i live in a rural area where the only available internet is data - capped which means i really cannot video chat ( which also cuts me off from the handful of theatre - adjacent opportunities that are out there ) and therapists are pretty much zoom - only these days . i do not know what to do . i am so afraid that these thoughts will take over and i will do something drastic just to make them stop . i'm sorry if this is the wrong place for something like this . i am happy to delete the post if it is .

"my entire life has been a constant struggle . i had a dysfunctional childhood with no friends and abusive parents . i was regarded as a weirdo and acted differently because i have autism and that makes it hard to socialize with others . this has made my life at school a living hell . i was bullied , teased , and even got beat up before and had to go to the hospital because of that . even today , i am in college and am struggling both academically and socially . i haven’t made a single friend and online classes have made it hard just to even attend class , let alone do the assignments . even as a physics major , i am failing my classes and this makes me feel even more useless . not only has my personal life been shitty , i am always living in fear of the future of not only me , but humanity as a whole . humans are corrupt greedy creatures that are destroying this planet to doom the youth and future generations , including me . climate change has already had devastating impacts like record breaking storms and infernos never seen before ( i live all the way in maryland and the skies were hazy from wildfire smoke 3 , 000 miles away . ) even with all this , most of the corrupt right wing denies it and continue to invest trillions in the ultra rich fossil fuel corporations . even after living through my traumatic childhood , i am now living in so much fear that i’ll witness armageddon and this has made me depressed and anxious . i wish i was never born . i just want to go to sleep and never wake up again . even if an afterlife doesn’t exist , an endless void of nothingness seems like heaven to me right now . somebody please help me . . .

" “ the cure for loneliness is solitude . ” — marianne moore hopper never painted this , but here on a snaky path his vision lingers : three white tombs , robots with glassed - in faces and meters for eyes , grim mouths , flat noses , lean forward on a platform , like strangers with identical frowns scanning a blur , far off , that might be their train . gas tanks broken for decades face parson’s smithy , planked shut now . both relics must stay . the pumps have roots in gas pools , and the smithy stores memories of hammers forging scythes to cut spartina grass for dry salt hay . the tanks have the remove of local clammers who sink buckets and stand , never in pairs , but one and one and one , blank - eyed , alone , more serene than lonely . today a woman rakes in the shallows , then bends to receive last rays in shimmering water , her long shadow knifing the bay . she slides into her truck to watch the sky flame over sand flats , a hawk’s wind arabesque , an island risen , brown atlantis , at low tide ; she probes the shoreline and beyond grassy dunes for where the land might slope off into night . hers is no common emptiness , but a vaster silence filled with terns’ cries , an abundant solitude . nearby , the three dry gas pumps , worn survivors of clam - digging generations , are luminous , and have an exile’s grandeur that says : in perfect solitude , there’s fire . one day i approached the vessels and wanted to drive on , the road ablaze with dogwood in full bloom , but the contraptions outdazzled the road’s white , even outshone a bleached shirt flapping alone on a laundry line , arms pointed down . high noon . three urns , ironic in their outcast dignity — as though , like some pine chests , they might be prized in disuse — cast rays , spun leaf — covered numbers , clanked , then wheezed and stopped again . shadows cut the road before i drove off into the dark woods .

"1 what does it matter if the words i choose , in the order i choose them in , go out into a silence i know nothing about , there to be let in and entertained and charmed out of their master’s orders ? and yet i would like to see where they go and how without me they behave . 2 speaking is difficult and one tries to be exact and yet not to exact the prime intention to death . on the other hand the appearance of things must not be made to mean another thing . it is a kind of triumph to see them and to put them down as what they are . the inadequacy of the living , animal language drives us all to metaphor and an attempt to organize the spaces we think we have made occur between the words . 3 the bad word and the bad word and the word which glamours me with some quick face it pulls to make me let it leave me to go across in roughly your direction , hates to go out maybe so completely on another silence not its own . 4 before i know it they are out afloat in the head which freezes them . then i suppose i take the best away and leave the others arranged like floating bergs to sink a convoy . 5 one word says to its mate o i do not think we go together are we doing any good here why do we find ourselves put down ? the mate pleased to be spoken to looks up from the line below and says well that doubtful god who has us here is far from sure how we on our own tickle the chin of the prince or the dame that lets us in . 6 the dark companion is a star very present like a dark poem far and unreadable just out at the edge of this poem floating . it is not more or less a dark companion poem to the poem . 7 language is expensive if we want to strut , busked out showing our best on silence . good morning . that is a bonny doing of verbs you wear with the celandine catching the same sun as mine . you wear your dress like a prince but a country’s prince beyond my ken . through the chinks in your lyric coat my ear catches a royal glimpse of fuzzed flesh , unworded body . was there something you wanted to say ? i myself dress up in what i can afford on the broadway . underneath my overcoat of the time’s slang i am fashionable enough wearing the grave - clothes of my generous masters . 8 and what are you supposed to say i asked a new word but it kept mum . i had secretly admired always what i thought it was here for . but i was wrong when i looked it up between the painted boards . it said something it was never very likely i could fit in to a poem in my life . 9 the good word said i am not pressed for time . i have all the foxglove day and all my user’s days to give you my attention . shines the red fox in the digitalis grove . choose me choose me . guess which word i am here calling myself the best . if you can’t fit me in to lying down here among the fox glove towers of the moment , say i am yours the more you use me . tomorrow same place same time give me a ring . 10 backwards the poem’s just as good . we human angels as we read read back as we gobble the words up . allowing the poem to represent a recognizable landscape sprouting green up or letting green with all its weight of love hang to gravity’s sweet affection , arse - versa it is the same object , even although the last word seems to have sung first , or the breakfast lark sings up from the bottom of the sea . 11 the poem is not a string of knots tied for a meaning of another time and county , unreadable , found by chance . the poem is not a henge or easter island emerged longnose or a tally used by early unknown peoples . the words we breathe and puff are our utensils down the dream into the manhole . replace the cover . 12 the words are mine . the thoughts are all yours as they occur behind the bat of your vast unseen eyes . these words are as you see them put down on the dead - still page . they have no ability above their station . their station on silence is exact . what you do with them is nobody’s business . 13 running across the language lightly this morning in the hangingover whistling light from the window , i was tripped and caught into the whole formal scheme which art is . i had only meant to enjoy dallying between the imaginary and imaginary’s opposite with a thought or two up my sleeve . 14 is the word ? yes yes . but i hear a sound without words from another person i can’t see at my elbow . a sigh to be proud of . you ? me ? 15 having to construct the silence first to speak out on i realize the silence even itself floats at my ear - side with a character i have not met before . hello hello i shout but that silence floats steady , will not be marked by an off - hand shout . for some reason it refuses to be broken now by what i thought was worth saying . if i wait a while , if i look out at the heavy greedy rooks on the wall it will disperse . now i construct a new silence i hope to break .

"they don’t wade in so much as they are taken . deep in the day , in the deep of the field , every current in the grasses whispers hurry hurry , every yellow spreads its perfume like a rumor , impelling them further on . it is the way of girls . it is the sway of their dresses in the summer trance - light , their bare calves already far - gone in green . what songs will they follow ? whatever the wood warbles , whatever storm or harm the border promises , whatever calm . let them go . let them go traceless through the high grass and into the willow - blur , traceless across the lean blue glint of the river , to the long dark bodies of the conifers , and over the welcoming threshold of nightfall .

"i’m 17 and for the past 2 years i couldn’t sleep until 3 because i was too busy thinking about different ways to kill myself and how painless i would be if i kill myself . i didn’t have control of my life anymore , pushed away my gf for 3 years into someone else , wasn’t doing well in school , lived under a mask to fit social standards and i just couldn’t bare living another day of pain and torture . everyday i would distract myself with youtube videos to the point where i know the plot and lines of almost all episodes of the simpsons , family guy , american dad , bojack horseman , bobs burgers , lucifer and grimm . now it doesn’t distract me anymore . i think of suicide watching those shows and nothing else and last night i planned it all out . i was fully prepared to go on that journey and i couldn’t do it . i couldn’t . what a coward i am i told myself . i didn’t even have control over the time i have on this world . i had control over nothing . now i’m lost and everything seems like a lie . people tell me i have things to live for but i don’t . i have no future , i’m too fat to be liked , i’m too dumb to be successful and i’m just hated by most . i just am genuinely lost .

"i have been depressed for a long time , i am not sure when , the hospital diagnosed me with mdd when i ended up there . now it is been six years , i have not had attempted suicide , i just always considered it , looking down the bridges or the balcony to see if i will survive . it started during grade eleven and hurt me the hardest during summer as i started cutting myself , then during grade 12 i was considering suicide which ended me up in the hospital and then i had to take grade thirteen as i lost too much time and fell behind in classes while i had a social worker and taking prozac actively . none of it was helping i was just dragging on . i attended college and changed majors twice , i spent one year in one and failed and another that i spent two years in until i could not take it anymore it was not only affecting me mentally , but it was hurting me physically , my immune system was compromised because of stress . i felt useless , i felt helpless and i must admit i had two counselors and i had been taking my medication regularly . i quit the medication , it was not helping me and i was spending most of the time in bed , and quit eating food for days , starving myself for . i came out of the major and took another one that felt better for me i had a very good gpa at first , i did still have counselors but i stopped the medication all together as i said earlier . so i was pretty confident with myself come the second year and i decided that i did not need counselors anymore so i closed my case with them . later that year i started struggling again , i was tired i spent sometimes sixteen hours in school just trying to get things done but i failed so many times and at the beginning of third year i gave up and came out of the program . my parents after my hospitalization kept saying it was okay that i am not performing well but that is not me . i wanted to perform well at least at one thing in my life , to complete college and probably get a good co - op opportunity but now after six years i am at square one . constantly thinking of suicide , feeling that i have no path forward , i am done hanging in there . all the time i struggled and told my friends , i just lost them as if i had no close friends . i still have my best friend and another close friend but i do not bother telling them how i feel everyday , but they stayed and know my story . oh i forgot to mention the obvious , i do not have a girlfriend or any relationship , i tried a few times with a few people but i failed and stopped perusing a relationship . i am just planning suicide again , i hate going back to that hospital with its shitty psychiatrists . i just do not know if i succeed but i am too much of a coward to do it .

"for bobbie yesterday i wanted to speak of it , that sense above the others to me important because all that i know derives from what it teaches me . today , what is it that is finally so helpless , different , despairs of its own statement , wants to turn away , endlessly to turn away . if the moon did not . . . no , if you did not i wouldn’t either , but what would i not do , what prevention , what thing so quickly stopped . that is love yesterday or tomorrow , not now . can i eat what you give me . i have not earned it . must i think of everything as earned . now love also becomes a reward so remote from me i have only made it with my mind . here is tedium , despair , a painful sense of isolation and whimsical if pompous self - regard . but that image is only of the mind’s vague structure , vague to me because it is my own . love , what do i think to say . i cannot say it . what have you become to ask , what have i made you into , companion , good company , crossed legs with skirt , or soft body under the bones of the bed . nothing says anything but that which it wishes would come true , fears what else might happen in some other place , some other time not this one . a voice in my place , an echo of that only in yours . let me stumble into not the confession but the obsession i begin with now . for you also ( also ) some time beyond place , or place beyond time , no mind left to say anything at all , that face gone , now . into the company of love it all returns .

"a new volcano has erupted , the papers say , and last week i was reading where some ship saw an island being born : at first a breath of steam , ten miles away ; and then a black fleck — basalt , probably — rose in the mate’s binoculars and caught on the horizon like a fly . they named it . but my poor old island’s still un - rediscovered , un - renamable . none of the books has ever got it right . well , i had fifty - two miserable , small volcanoes i could climb with a few slithery strides — volcanoes dead as ash heaps . i used to sit on the edge of the highest one and count the others standing up , naked and leaden , with their heads blown off . i’d think that if they were the size i thought volcanoes should be , then i had become a giant ; and if i had become a giant , i couldn’t bear to think what size the goats and turtles were , or the gulls , or the overlapping rollers — a glittering hexagon of rollers closing and closing in , but never quite , glittering and glittering , though the sky was mostly overcast . my island seemed to be a sort of cloud - dump . all the hemisphere’s left - over clouds arrived and hung above the craters — their parched throats were hot to touch . was that why it rained so much ? and why sometimes the whole place hissed ? the turtles lumbered by , high - domed , hissing like teakettles . ( and i’d have given years , or taken a few , for any sort of kettle , of course . ) the folds of lava , running out to sea , would hiss . i’d turn . and then they’d prove to be more turtles . the beaches were all lava , variegated , black , red , and white , and gray ; the marbled colors made a fine display . and i had waterspouts . oh , half a dozen at a time , far out , they’d come and go , advancing and retreating , their heads in cloud , their feet in moving patches of scuffed - up white . glass chimneys , flexible , attenuated , sacerdotal beings of glass . . . i watched the water spiral up in them like smoke . beautiful , yes , but not much company . i often gave way to self - pity . “ do i deserve this ? i suppose i must . i wouldn’t be here otherwise . was there a moment when i actually chose this ? i don’t remember , but there could have been . ” what’s wrong about self - pity , anyway ? with my legs dangling down familiarly over a crater’s edge , i told myself “ pity should begin at home . ” so the more pity i felt , the more i felt at home . the sun set in the sea ; the same odd sun rose from the sea , and there was one of it and one of me . the island had one kind of everything : one tree snail , a bright violet - blue with a thin shell , crept over everything , over the one variety of tree , a sooty , scrub affair . snail shells lay under these in drifts and , at a distance , you’d swear that they were beds of irises . there was one kind of berry , a dark red . i tried it , one by one , and hours apart . sub - acid , and not bad , no ill effects ; and so i made home - brew . i’d drink the awful , fizzy , stinging stuff that went straight to my head and play my home - made flute ( i think it had the weirdest scale on earth ) and , dizzy , whoop and dance among the goats . home - made , home - made ! but aren’t we all ? i felt a deep affection for the smallest of my island industries . no , not exactly , since the smallest was a miserable philosophy . because i didn’t know enough . why didn’t i know enough of something ? greek drama or astronomy ? the books i’d read were full of blanks ; the poems — well , i tried reciting to my iris - beds , “ they flash upon that inward eye , which is the bliss . . . ” the bliss of what ? one of the first things that i did when i got back was look it up . the island smelled of goat and guano . the goats were white , so were the gulls , and both too tame , or else they thought i was a goat , too , or a gull . baa , baa , baa and shriek , shriek , shriek , baa . . . shriek . . .

'tis calm indeed ! so calm , that it disturbs and vexes meditation with its strange and extreme silentness . sea , hill , and wood , this populous village ! sea , and hill , and wood , with all the numberless goings - on of life , inaudible as dreams ! the thin blue flame lies on my low - burnt fire , and quivers not ; only that film , which fluttered on the grate , still flutters there , the sole unquiet thing . methinks , its motion in this hush of nature gives it dim sympathies with me who live , making it a companionable form , whose puny flaps and freaks the idling spirit by its own moods interprets , every where echo or mirror seeking of itself , and makes a toy of thought . but o ! how oft , how oft , at school , with most believing mind , presageful , have i gazed upon the bars , to watch that fluttering stranger ! and as oft with unclosed lids , already had i dreamt of my sweet birth - place , and the old church - tower , whose bells , the poor man's only music , rang from morn to evening , all the hot fair - day , so sweetly , that they stirred and haunted me with a wild pleasure , falling on mine ear most like articulate sounds of things to come ! so gazed i , till the soothing things , i dreamt , lulled me to sleep , and sleep prolonged my dreams ! and so i brooded all the following morn , awed by the stern preceptor's face , mine eye fixed with mock study on my swimming book : save if the door half opened , and i snatched a hasty glance , and still my heart leaped up , for still i hoped to see the stranger's face , townsman , or aunt , or sister more beloved , my play - mate when we both were clothed alike ! dear babe , that sleepest cradled by my side , whose gentle breathings , heard in this deep calm , fill up the intersperséd vacancies and momentary pauses of the thought ! my babe so beautiful ! it thrills my heart with tender gladness , thus to look at thee , and think that thou shalt learn far other lore , and in far other scenes ! for i was reared in the great city , pent 'mid cloisters dim , and saw nought lovely but the sky and stars . but thou , my babe ! shalt wander like a breeze by lakes and sandy shores , beneath the crags of ancient mountain , and beneath the clouds , which image in their bulk both lakes and shores and mountain crags : so shalt thou see and hear the lovely shapes and sounds intelligible of that eternal language , which thy god utters , who from eternity doth teach himself in all , and all things in himself . great universal teacher ! he shall mould thy spirit , and by giving make it ask . therefore all seasons shall be sweet to thee , whether the summer clothe the general earth with greenness , or the redbreast sit and sing betwixt the tufts of snow on the bare branch of mossy apple - tree , while the night - thatch smokes in the sun - thaw ; whether the eave - drops fall heard only in the trances of the blast , or if the secret ministry of frost shall hang them up in silent icicles , quietly shining to the quiet moon .

"for rafael heliodoro valle i set out from the port of acapulco on the twenty - third of march and kept a steady course until saturday , the fourth of april , when a half hour before dawn , we saw by the light of the moon that a ship had come alongside with sails and a bow that seemed to be of silver . our helmsman cried out to them to stand off but no one answered , as though they were all asleep . again we called out : “ where did their ship come from ? ” and they said : peru ! after which we heard trumpets , and muskets firing , and they ordered me to come down into their longboat to cross over to where their captain was . i found him walking the deck , went up to him , kissed his hands and he asked me : “ what silver or gold i had aboard that ship ? ” i said , “ none at all , none at all , my lord , only my dishes and cups . ” so then he asked me if i knew the viceroy . i said i did . and i asked the captain , “ if he were captain drake himself and no other ? ” the captain replied that “ he was the very drake i spoke of . ” we spoke together a long time , until the hour of dinner , and he commanded that i sit by his side . his dishes and cups are of silver , bordered with gold with his crest upon them . he has with him many perfumes and scented waters in crystal vials which , he said , the queen had given him . he dines and sups always with music of violins and also takes with him everywhere painters who keep painting all the coast for him . he is a man of some twenty - four years , small , with a reddish beard . he is a nephew of juan aquinas , * the pirate . and is one of the greatest mariners there are upon the sea . the day after , which was sunday , he clothed himself in splendid garments and had them hoist all their flags with pennants of divers colors at the mastheads , the bronze rings , and chains , and the railings and the lights on the alcazar shining like gold . his ship was like a gold dragon among the dolphins . and we went , with his page , to my ship to look at the coffers . all day long until night he spent looking at what i had . what he took from me was not much , a few trifles of my own , and he gave me a cutlass and a silver brassart for them , asking me to forgive him since it was for his lady that he was taking them : he would let me go , he said , the next morning , as soon as there was a breeze ; for this i thanked him , and kissed his hands . he is carrying , in his galleon , three thousand bars of silver three coffers full of gold twelve great coffers of pieces of eight : and he says he is heading for china following the charts and steered by a chinese pilot whom he captured . . .

"caring about my cognitive capabilities , my education , my values and my goals , has become a curse during the last four years . i use to say that my crusade started four years ago , but there is not something like a traumatic event which triggered my mental issues . anyway , i began to experience oscillation in my mood : for two or three days i was sad , pessimistic , tired , then for less than one day i felt happy , creative , exhalted . three years ago i had a little scaramouche with cancer . luckily a pharmacological therapy was not necessary and in less than a month i was free from the disease without permanent damage , but i guess it has affected my mental health in some way . it was just one year ago that i looked for help , after years of sadness , psychosomatic issues as ibs and lack of satisfying social relations . when i undertook therapy i was still a person , with aims , dreams , hobbies , and capable after all to function as everyone else . now i feel broken , ill , tired of life . while i expected to find in therapy the support to become the man i wanted to be , i actually spent one year seeing my mental health collapse day after day . since the end of 2019 until yesterday night i suffered of a terrible insomnia . even if the first episodes of insomnia occurred two months before the beginning of the therapy , the disease just exploded in december . go through the day after two whole nights awake is a torture . i have seen my sense of reality fading away , my body becoming weaker . hang out in the evening has become difficult and sorrowful . i could do nothing while my head was falling apart , night after night . now i want to end a life that is just an humiliation of my soul . life had meaning once . even just one year ago , before chronic insomnia occurred , i wanted to live despite the sorrow . i had a vivacious intellect , and endless curiosity . i was interested deeply in lot of things , the subjects i study ( physics and math ) , reading , writing , music , gym . now i feel both my brain and my body broken . sleep deprivation kills any gain of workout , and its cognitive effects makes me hard to study , read , and even think properly . when my symptoms started four years ago i felt my mind usurped by intrusive thoughts ( i suffer from overcontrol , that causes obsessions ) and then insomnia and the sleep aids that i had to use for months have probably permanently fucked my brain . i just want my mind back . i deserve to have my mind back . i see no place in the world where i can find help to come back to my old self , where things that once gave meaning to my life have some value .

"who was the woman who lived in the kingdom behind the barrier . there are those who will tell you she was the wife of every man in the village . and one night while her husbands were finishing their day at the gasworks , the woman was boiling oats for her only child , a young girl who’d amassed a beautiful collection of spoons in her life , each one given to her by one of her mother’s husbands . and this same night the young daughter died . and the woman buried the daughter with her spoons in her pockets . come daybreak the hostiles appeared at the barrier with ice in their beards . “ to hell with pax americana , ” they said . and they camped outside the wall that night chanting war cries . you say you want to know the names of the war cries that survived history . “ wheel the gun carriages up to the barrier of the empire of husbands . ” “ our first word is ruin and our next word is value . ” there are those who will tell you the hostiles carried on like this for some weeks . until one night the dead daughter led them behind the barrier , through a tunnel she’d dug in the earth with her spoons . it was thus the hostiles made it their business to burn everything . they burned the village crops and the distillery . they burned the apothecary , the potash mine . black soot fell on the livery and they burned the livery too . and there’s another war cry that’s since survived history : “ tonight like god’s scalp in your kingdom behind the barrier our burning makes snow and ends nowhere . ” you say , where were the village husbands while all of this was happening . there are those who will tell you they were working their jobs at the gasworks , and when they heard the bullhorn roar in the watchtower they were smoking cigarillos and pacing the floor of the gasworks . and the roar of the bullhorn had a strange effect on the husbands , who each began daydreaming of his wife at home in the village . the first husband thought : “ the taste of the breath of my wife , it’s like saying the word houndstooth to myself in the dark . ” the next husband thought of her letting her hair down in front of a vanity , and smearing her blue eye shadow onto her fingers , and plucking the stray hairs and flyaways off her head . the next husband thought of her saying , “ i’m correcting god’s blunders , ” when he asked her why she wears all this foundation on her face . another husband thought : “ quitting time is worthless to me so long as the work i do in the gasworks makes me think of my wife’s jawbone . ” and all together the husbands said : “ the jawbones of my wife , they beat both the same , like when i watch a train leave the kingdom , and all i can see is the pistons beating away in the smoke . ” and when the hostiles entered the gasworks the husbands were dancing . and you say you want to know the words the hostiles spoke when they entered . there are those who will tell you they said this : “ don’t quit dancing . ” “ there’s a penalty for an empire that believes it can survive itself , ” they said . and so they pointed their war clubs at the husbands , and they said don’t quit , don’t quit dancing on the floor of the gasworks , and they bludgeoned to death the husbands who refused to keep dancing , and one by one the husbands fell dead on the floor of the gasworks , each one dancing himself to death at the hands of the hostiles . and this dancing took many deaths . but you say where was the wife who lost all her husbands this day . there are those who will tell you she was hiding the last of the cheese in a boot . she was rolling up the deed to her house in the village . she was picking up her daughter’s violin and stuffing the scroll in the violin’s f - hole . she was fleeing for the wall when she was stopped by the hostiles . dance , said the hostiles , and they pointed their war clubs at her skull . and these war clubs had a strange effect on the wife , who began daydreaming about a man who wasn’t her husband . she thought of cutting his hair in a sunflower patch in the village . the time should be dusk , she thought , and the shears , they should flash once in her hands like a scythe . she thought there should be two swarms of no - see - ums , one smoldering around each of her hands . and she’d tilt back the head of the man who wasn’t her husband . and she’d oil his throat with the badger brush in her hand . and he’d smell the sandalwood lather she worked in the bristles . and he’d smell the eau de cologne on her neck when she leaned in close . and she’d shave his throat with the blade of a balisong . and the woman thought each time he moaned when she stroked him a dragonfly should dance from his mouth . and he’ll moan until the dragonfly quits dancing , she thought . and i’ll dance around his throat all night like a lantern . “ because a war club doesn’t taste like a war club , ” she said . “ it tastes like my husbands all breathing at once . ” she spoke these words with a hole in her skull in the snow . and the smoke coming out of the hole was her thoughts . and her body lying there in the village square was so beautiful the hostiles began to dance on either side of the body . and they danced , and they danced , until they too fell dead in the snow beside her .

"my grandma ended up calling , and i just kept scrolling . i realized how messed up it was , so i stopped . after a few minutes i just got more depressed realizing how lonely she is and how old and sick my dad is getting , so i kept scrolling . this is probably just a vent . i am trying to stay alive as long as possible for my so , but at the same time i think i am buying it today . all i will say is it is extremely effective . i have had 3 failed attempts including a very poorly executed one at age 7 or 8 . i am 24 now . it makes me cry just thinking about how much i have suffered in those 21 years . i just feel like i am constantly trying to pick myself up after something major knocks me down , and if i am honest , half the time i am the problem . most people would say i have a happy disposition . i laugh so easily . i have been told i am funny , but i am miserable all the time . i will cry of laughter and sadness at the same time all the time . they would say i am a little hard on myself . but i am happy and nice . on the inside , i am constantly tearing myself and the world around me down . i do not hate most individuals i meet , but when i look at the world it makes me hate humanity . when i realize people i know are contributing to what i see wrong with the world i cannot help but get extremely frustrated . i cannot help but think they are foolish or have been lied to . i do not even relate to people who do not experience this feeling of hate and disgust for the world . i feel like a fraud even posting here . i feel like a fraud most of the time . i study computer science and take extra classes in mathematics ( i used to like it ) . even when i am doing ok in my studies i feel like i am drowning , but it is never been as bad as this semester . i started developing these panic attacks or whatever where i cannot think straight and my head gets really hot . i simply cannot do school in this condition . it is pathetic . i hate that my problems just comes down to "" my feelings are out of control "" . for a while i have had other excuses and now i feel like shit for using them as excuses . now i realize that i am the problem . i had convinced myself to build up a little confidence , and what happened ? i became a binge drinker and basically told my so to go fuck himself when he got concerned . i kept that attitude up for way too long . i deserve to have no confidence . i know i deserve to die . i've been thinking i have a pd . i go back and forth on which one i think i have over the years , but now i am thinking quiet bpd . i will not speak for anyone else who has or might have this disorder , but fuck this . fuck the shitty treatment outcomes , fuck the doctors that want to traumatize you with inpatient , fuck big pharma , and seriously fuck being told i am irreparably broken just to have some doctor manipulate me into being what they consider not broken . i was traumatized by psychiatric institutions , but i am crazy so no one will take me seriously or care . whatever . this is enough rambling . sorry for even posting . i'll be deleting this account in a few hours , maybe a day .

"i'd say about 80 % of my thoughts everyday for the past year or so ( probably more ) used to be about the future , worrying and constantly feeling on edge , but i realised recently that i have stopped worrying about the future almost completely . i was not sure why , but i thought about it , and i realised that it is because i have already subconciously accepted that i will probably commit suicide before i let life get to an unbearable stage , before life gets like how i used to worry it would be like . it feels weird knowing that i am the closest to suicide i have ever been in my life , yet my anxiety is barely there anymore because of this acceptance . it is scary because of course i do not really want to die , but i feel like my life is on a path to becoming completely hopeless and unliveable . it is like i see suicide as my wildcard i can easily whip out for when my life inevetably gets to that unliveable stage . sometimes i wish my friends knew how i felt , but they would probably think i am crazy , and i do feel like i am sometimes . i am so thankful that reddit exists though , makes me feel a little less crazy .

"subconsciously manipulating a person with suicidal threats . . . ? . i met a guy on tinder . we hit it off and i really thought it would turn into something more . after three days , i told him i liked him and i guess he thought i was already thinking about a relationship happening right then and there which wasn’t the case . after explaining several times this wasn’t the case , he eventually wanted to slow down and just be friends . he assured me that he was still down to see if it could turn into more but everything changed after that . he was no longer complementing me , he would leave my texts unread for longer than usual or not respond to them at all unless i reminded him of it and blew me off when we had plans to hang out . eventually i hated myself for telling him i liked him , even though i know it wasn’t wrong and he shouldn’t have overreacted like he did . whenever i brought this up , he would get upset and not want to talk about it anymore . right before he told me he just wanted to be friends and slow down he told me i could call him whenever . this was because i confided in him about my mental issues including suicidal attempts / thoughts . he told me he could relate to thinking about suicide and being depressed and said a lot of things to make me feel better . me meeting him was the happiest thing i’ve experienced in the last couple of months . so when he started treating me different than he did when we first met , i felt hopeless . i felt like a failure and unworthy of life . even though he said he said it could still possibly be more , it felt like he made up his mind already and the answer was no . i started to realize that maybe me bringing up the situation made him rethink that and he really was willing to be serious if it came to that but by that point i already ruined it . because of this , my thoughts about suicide increased . i hated myself and i felt like i made too many mistakes to want to live with . this person who i had just met didn’t even want to talk to me as much so i felt like a burden to everyone . i told him about these thoughts and he did everything he could to make me feel better . i wouldn’t listen . i was so sure i wanted to kill my self and no one could talk me out of it . i told him because it felt good to have someone that would listen . but he seemed annoyed as well and overwhelmed so that’s why him trying to make me feel better made no difference . many times i revisited our initial situation and it just drive him away and made him only want to be my friend and nothing more . every time he said this , it triggered a suicidal thought . i automatically thought about hurting myself . i wanted nothing more than a chance with this person and i felt so stupid for ruining it in 3 days even though he kept telling me i didn’t . i felt hurt and rejected and useless . every time he showed me or told me he only wanted to be friends ( whether it was for that moment or permanent ) i told him i wanted to die . he kept telling me to get professional help but i wouldn’t listen . i felt he lied to me for promising i could call him anytime but also telling me he couldn’t help me all the time . it felt like a slap in the face and that triggered my suicidal thoughts also . i never lied when i said i felt suicidal . i never made any of it up . every time i was genuinely suicidal . i wanted him to know how i felt but i never blamed him for how i felt . i blamed myself . i made sure he didn’t feel responsible although i know he still did . i feel so bad for hurting him and i feel like i manipulated him even though i never told him i wanted to kill myself as a way to get him to do things he didn’t want to . now i don’t want to tell people when i feel suicidal . it feels wrong .

" ( excerpt ) an anatomy of the world wherein , by occasion of the untimely death of mistress elizabeth drury , the frailty and the decay of this whole world is represented the first anniversary when that rich soul which to her heaven is gone , whom all do celebrate , who know they have one ( for who is sure he hath a soul , unless it see , and judge , and follow worthiness , and by deeds praise it ? he who doth not this , may lodge an inmate soul , but 'tis not his ) when that queen ended here her progress time , and , as t'her standing house , to heaven did climb , where loath to make the saints attend her long , she's now a part both of the choir , and song ; this world , in that great earthquake languished ; for in a common bath of tears it bled , which drew the strongest vital spirits out ; but succour'd then with a perplexed doubt , whether the world did lose , or gain in this , ( because since now no other way there is , but goodness , to see her , whom all would see , all must endeavour to be good as she ) this great consumption to a fever turn'd , and so the world had fits ; it joy'd , it mourn'd ; and , as men think , that agues physic are , and th' ague being spent , give over care , so thou , sick world , mistak'st thy self to be well , when alas , thou'rt in a lethargy . her death did wound and tame thee then , and then thou might'st have better spar'd the sun , or man . that wound was deep , but 'tis more misery that thou hast lost thy sense and memory . 'twas heavy then to hear thy voice of moan , but this is worse , that thou art speechless grown . thou hast forgot thy name thou hadst ; thou wast nothing but she , and her thou hast o'erpast . for , as a child kept from the font until a prince , expected long , come to fulfill the ceremonies , thou unnam'd had'st laid , had not her coming , thee her palace made ; her name defin'd thee , gave thee form , and frame , and thou forget'st to celebrate thy name . some months she hath been dead ( but being dead , measures of times are all determined ) but long she'ath been away , long , long , yet none offers to tell us who it is that is gone . but as in states doubtful of future heirs , when sickness without remedy impairs the present prince , they are loath it should be said , "" the prince doth languish , "" or "" the prince is dead ; "" so mankind feeling now a general thaw , a strong example gone , equal to law , the cement which did faithfully compact and glue all virtues , now resolv'd , and slack'd , thought it some blasphemy to say sh'was dead , or that our weakness was discovered in that confession ; therefore spoke no more than tongues , the soul being gone , the loss deplore . but though it be too late to succour thee , sick world , yea dead , yea putrified , since she thy' intrinsic balm , and thy preservative , can never be renew'd , thou never live , i ( since no man can make thee live ) will try , what we may gain by thy anatomy . her death hath taught us dearly that thou art corrupt and mortal in thy purest part . let no man say , the world itself being dead , 'tis labour lost to have discovered the world's infirmities , since there is none alive to study this dissection ; for there is a kind of world remaining still , though she which did inanimate and fill the world , be gone , yet in this last long night , her ghost doth walk ; that is a glimmering light , a faint weak love of virtue , and of good , reflects from her on them which understood her worth ; and though she have shut in all day , the twilight of her memory doth stay , which , from the carcass of the old world free , creates a new world , and new creatures be produc'd . the matter and the stuff of this , her virtue , and the form our practice is . and though to be thus elemented , arm these creatures from home - born intrinsic harm , ( for all assum'd unto this dignity so many weedless paradises be , which of themselves produce no venomous sin , except some foreign serpent bring it in ) yet , because outward storms the strongest break , and strength itself by confidence grows weak , this new world may be safer , being told the dangers and diseases of the old ; for with due temper men do then forgo , or covet things , when they their true worth know . there is no health ; physicians say that we at best enjoy but a neutrality . and can there be worse sickness than to know that we are never well , nor can be so ?

who lives to age , fit to be made methusalem his page ? alas , we scarce live long enough to try whether a true - made clock run right , or lie . old grandsires talk of yesterday with sorrow , and for our children we reserve tomorrow . so short is life , that every peasant strives , in a torn house , or field , to have three lives . and as in lasting , so in length is man contracted to an inch , who was a span ; for had a man at first in forests stray'd , or shipwrack'd in the sea , one would have laid a wager , that an elephant , or whale , that met him , would not hastily assail a thing so equall to him ; now alas , the fairies , and the pigmies well may pass as credible ; mankind decays so soon , we'are scarce our fathers' shadows cast at noon , only death adds t'our length : nor are we grown in stature to be men , till we are none . but this were light , did our less volume hold all the old text ; or had we chang'd to gold their silver ; or dispos'd into less glass spirits of virtue , which then scatter'd was . but 'tis not so ; w'are not retir'd , but damp'd ; and as our bodies , so our minds are cramp'd ; 'tis shrinking , not close weaving , that hath thus in mind and body both bedwarfed us . we seem ambitious , god's whole work t'undo ; of nothing he made us , and we strive too , to bring our selves to nothing back ; and we do what we can , to do't so soon as he . with new diseases on our selves we war , and with new physic , a worse engine far . thus man , this world's vice - emperor , in whom all faculties , all graces are at home ( and if in other creatures they appear , they're but man's ministers and legates there to work on their rebellions , and reduce them to civility , and to man's use ) ; this man , whom god did woo , and loath t'attend till man came up , did down to man descend , this man , so great , that all that is , is his , o what a trifle , and poor thing he is ! if man were anything , he is nothing now ; help , or at least some time to waste , allow t'his other wants , yet when he did depart with her whom we lament , he lost his heart . she , of whom th'ancients seem'd to prophesy , when they call'd virtues by the name of she ; she in whom virtue was so much refin'd , that for alloy unto so pure a mind she took the weaker sex ; she that could drive the poisonous tincture , and the stain of eve , out of her thoughts , and deeds , and purify all , by a true religious alchemy , she , she is dead ; she is dead : when thou knowest this , thou knowest how poor a trifling thing man is , and learn'st thus much by our anatomy , the heart being perish'd , no part can be free , and that except thou feed ( not banquet ) on the supernatural food , religion , thy better growth grows withered , and scant ; be more than man , or thou'rt less than an ant . then , as mankind , so is the world's whole frame quite out of joint , almost created lame , for , before god had made up all the rest , corruption ent'red , and deprav'd the best ; it seiz'd the angels , and then first of all the world did in her cradle take a fall , and turn'd her brains , and took a general maim , wronging each joint of th'universal frame . the noblest part , man , felt it first ; and then both beasts and plants , curs'd in the curse of man . so did the world from the first hour decay , that evening was beginning of the day , and now the springs and summers which we see , like sons of women after fifty be . and new philosophy calls all in doubt , the element of fire is quite put out , the sun is lost , and th'earth , and no man's wit can well direct him where to look for it . and freely men confess that this world's spent , when in the planets and the firmament they seek so many new ; they see that this is crumbled out again to his atomies . 'tis all in pieces , all coherence gone , all just supply , and all relation ; prince , subject , father , son , are things forgot , for every man alone thinks he hath got to be a phoenix , and that then can be none of that kind , of which he is , but he . this is the world's condition now , and now she that should all parts to reunion bow , she that had all magnetic force alone , to draw , and fasten sund'red parts in one ; she whom wise nature had invented then when she observ'd that every sort of men did in their voyage in this world's sea stray , and needed a new compass for their way ; she that was best and first original of all fair copies , and the general steward to fate ; she whose rich eyes and breast gilt the west indies , and perfum'd the east ; whose having breath'd in this world , did bestow spice on those isles , and bade them still smell so , and that rich india which doth gold inter , is but as single money , coin'd from her ; she to whom this world must it self refer , as suburbs or the microcosm of her , she , she is dead ; she is dead : when thou know'st this , thou know'st how lame a cripple this world is",0,,,819

" ( on the signing of the armistice , 11 nov . 1918 ) i there had been years of passion — scorching , cold , and much despair , and anger heaving high , care whitely watching , sorrows manifold , among the young , among the weak and old , and the pensive spirit of pity whispered , “ why ? ” ii men had not paused to answer . foes distraught pierced the thinned peoples in a brute - like blindness , philosophies that sages long had taught , and selflessness , were as an unknown thought , and “ hell ! ” and “ shell ! ” were yapped at lovingkindness . iii the feeble folk at home had grown full - used to 'dug - outs' , 'snipers' , 'huns' , from the war - adept in the mornings heard , and at evetides perused ; to day - dreamt men in millions , when they mused — to nightmare - men in millions when they slept . iv waking to wish existence timeless , null , sirius they watched above where armies fell ; he seemed to check his flapping when , in the lull of night a boom came thencewise , like the dull plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well . v so , when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly were dead and damned , there sounded 'war is done ! ' one morrow . said the bereft , and meek , and lowly , 'will men some day be given to grace ? yea , wholly , and in good sooth , as our dreams used to run ? ' vi breathless they paused . out there men raised their glance to where had stood those poplars lank and lopped , as they had raised it through the four years’ dance of death in the now familiar flats of france ; and murmured , 'strange , this ! how ? all firing stopped ? ' vii aye ; all was hushed . the about - to - fire fired not , the aimed - at moved away in trance - lipped song . one checkless regiment slung a clinching shot and turned . the spirit of irony smirked out , 'what ? spoil peradventures woven of rage and wrong ? ' viii thenceforth no flying fires inflamed the gray , no hurtlings shook the dewdrop from the thorn , no moan perplexed the mute bird on the spray ; worn horses mused : 'we are not whipped to - day ; ' no weft - winged engines blurred the moon’s thin horn . ix calm fell . from heaven distilled a clemency ; there was peace on earth , and silence in the sky ; some could , some could not , shake off misery : the sinister spirit sneered : 'it had to be !

" ( sorry if it is long , i would appreciate it if you read it in all but i will make a summary at the end in case you do not want to read it all ) this is being a shitty year . i have always been a person with very low self - esteem and i’m ridiculous and i feel very bad being around others because they see that i’m stupid . despite all this i have always been very joyful and everyone thinks that i am very happy . at the beginning of this year i began to feel very bad and i began to wish i had not been born , the world completely lost its sense . everything is unfair , dark and evil , and i do not understand how human beings can be so cruel and i feel very stupid because things that have nothing to do with me hurt me very deeply . when the quarantine began here in spain , i had a terrible time , the months that we were locked up at home i spent all day without leaving my room and i began to distance myself a lot from my friends . i was not talking to them and i thought they’d be better without me . those months i could not even hear my own voice and when i cried i had to put on my headphones with music because it made me sick to listen to myself . at the end of april i found out from another friend that my best friend was having a bad time and she and that she did not want to tell me anything about that , and in the middle of the following month my best friend told me that she wanted to commit suicide and that her parents had sent her to the emergency psychiatrist and that she was going to go to the psychologist . i could not see her because we were in quarantine and i was incredibly afraid that she would die and that i could not do anything , i spent weeks crying every day . the days went by and i finally could see her and although she was bad it seemed that in time she would recover . i felt very guilty and very stupid and i thought i was a shitty friend and that she deserved to have better friends . two weeks before ” selectividad ” ( university entrance exams ) my parents divorced . it was a very unexpected blow because everything seemed fine . i have spent these months near to my mother because she is so sad , and my father does not speak to me almost anything , it seems that he forgot that he has children . sometimes i think that he has never loved me . less than a month ago my grandfather died , i saw him sick and more and more sunken , until he died . this also affected my mother a lot because he was her father . despite all this i know that my mother will be fine because she is going to the psychologist and little by little i see her better . i feel nothing when i meet my friends and i have been selfharming for months to calm my pain . i keep thinking that everyone secretly dislikes me even though they are nice to me . today my best friend told me that she wanted to commit suicide . it is hard for me to tell her to try to be strong and fight again because i understand what it’s to be so exhausted that you just want to end it all , i am not able to tell her anything so that she understands that life is worth living because i do not find the meaning of life either , i am incapable to honestly tell her that cutting is wrong because i cannot stop doing it myself and i do not understand why . [ summary and end ] i am an insecure person and i feel stupid around others , this year my best friend is suffering from depression and i have not been able to help her , my parents got divorced , my grandfather has died , i am selfharming after three years without doing so and i have been having suicidal thoughts for months . best friend told me that she wanted to commit suicide and i have not been able to tell her anything because i cannot find a reason not to do it either . now she is in the emergency psychiatrist because i managed to convince her to tell her parents , but she is sure that she is going to do it and i know that she will die because i am stupid and i have never been able to help her . she needs a friend who is not a problem anymore , someone who can really help her , not me . she is my reason to live and i am not able to do anything now , i feel useless , stupid , garbage ! for this and for everything . i need some advice to help her because i do not know what to do ! ! ! !

"this is how it was : they had their own churches , their own schools , schoolbuses , football teams , bands and majorettes , separate restaurants , in all the public places their own bathrooms , at the doctor’s their own waiting room , in the tribune a column for their news , in the village a neighborhood called sugar hill , uneven rows of unresponsive houses that took the maids back in each afternoon — in our homes used the designated door , on trailways sat in the back , and at the movie paid at a separate entrance , stayed upstairs . saturdays , a double feature drew the local kids as the town bulged , families surfacing for groceries , medicine and wine , the black barber , white clerks in the stores — crowds lined the sidewalks , swirled through the courthouse yard , around the stone soldier and the flag , and still i never saw them on the street . it seemed a chivalric code laced the milk : you’d try not to look and they would try to be invisible . once , on my way to the creek , i went without permission to the tenants’ log cabin near the barns , and when aunt susie opened the door , a cave yawned , and beyond her square , leonine , freckled face , in the hushed interior , joe white lumbered up from the table , six unfolding feet of him , dark as a gun - barrel , his head bent to clear the chinked rafters , and i caught the terrifying smell of sweat and grease , smell of the woodstove , nightjar , straw mattress — this was rural piedmont , upper south ; we lived on a farm but not in poverty . when finally we got our own tv , the evening news with its hooded figures of the ku klux klan seemed like another movie — king solomon’s mines , the serial of atlantis in the sea . by then i was thirteen , and no longer went to movies to see movies . the downstairs forged its attentions forward , toward the lit horizon , but leaning a little to one side or the other , arranging the pairs that would own the county , stores and farms , everything but easy passage out of there — and through my wing - tipped glasses the balcony took on a sullen glamor : whenever the film sputtered on the reel , when the music died and the lights came on , i swiveled my face up to where they whooped and swore , to the smoky blue haze and that tribe of black and brown , licorice , coffee , taffy , red oak , sweet tea — wanting to look , not knowing how to see , i thought it was a special privilege to enter the side door , climb the stairs and scan the even rows below — trained bears in a pit , herded by the stringent rule , while they were free , lounging above us , their laughter pelting down on us like trash .

"throughout my life , i was never really happy , just okay and fine with that , occasionally suicidal at hard times but never serious about it . until june last year when i found him . i experienced the highest of highs with him . in february i was dumped by the only person i have ever truly loved , more than anything . i spiralled downwards from there , being severely suicidal at the start of lockdown , but kind of eventually started to feel better and a bit hopeful . in june we reconciled , and i was so happy again . but at the start of july , he dumped me again , this time for good , and cut me out of his life entirely . i decided to try the single life and see if that could be good for me , but i discovered some awful things on a sub for single men , and i started getting resentful towards men . i joined a dating site especially to break down egotistical guys through rejecting them . i saw more and more awful things in people , in the world , in life , as i did all of this . i began to hate more than just men , i began to hate the world and being in it . it is a terrible and dark place to be in . but through this , i had 4 internet friends ( real life friends all abandoned me when i started getting depressed ) that i thought i could count on , 2 of them guys . in the last week , i lost both of those guy friends , one because he wanted to focus on himself , and the other because he does not like who i have become . and this really hit me hard , i have 2 friends left . and i feel like just isolating myself from everyone because they are all going to abandon me in the same way . added to that , i am losing my childhood home this week , the place i grew up in an found comfort in , and it just hurts so much . i do not want to leave , but i have to . i've sort of become a bit of a drug addict as i now tend to use prescription medications to numb out the pain i feel , and that is the only time i feel relatively normal , but i know i am doing long term damage to my body . and the one thing i never thought i would be is a drug addict , yet here i am , a drug addict . my career dream is also impossible to reach because of not having money to and because of my deteriorating health . i experienced fluoroquinolone toxicity which caused heart problems that could make me fail a medical . and if i do not get this career path , i do not have a passion for anything else and i feel so purposeless . starting on september 23 , is every romantic anniversary with my ex . and it already hurts so much to go through friendship anniversaries , so i know these are going to be worse . he was my hope and my happiness , i loved him with all of my heart , now i have to go through these dates alone , missing him and the times we had together last year , wondering what could have been if he stayed . and so many songs remind me of specific memories of him , that it is difficult to escape , and i love music . a lot of the time i wish i would never met him . i would not have known the happiness that i felt with him , and i would not know the horrible things i have seen as a result of losing him . i've been in therapy since march and it is made absolutely no difference to my state of mind at all , i am still actually deteriorating . so that is a lost cause for me . a lot of other bad things and losses happened to me this year , but at this time they are minor ones compared to what i have mentioned here . i feel so afraid , alone , in pain , and like everything i dare to care about abandons me . i do not see a future for myself in the world that i have seen and experienced . it is awful and i have been so disillusioned . i have no hope left . i wish i still had that innocence that i did during my school years , but it is all gone and i have experienced adult life , it is horrible . i planned my suicide for my last night in my childhood home , this weekend . i will ask to stay here alone for just one more night , overdose on a combo of benzos and opiates and sit in the bath , hopefully passing out and drowning , but maybe also dying of respiratory depression . i want to die in the place i grew up . end it all where it started . i do not really want to be convinced out of it by saying that people care , random people on the internet do not know me and will not feel the loss . i have 2 internet friends left who will probably leave anyway , so they will not feel it either . i think only my family would feel it , but they would survive because we are not that close anyway . i just wanted to put this on here , get my feelings out somehow , somewhere that people can see it but not overreact , where they would understand where i am coming from .

"when you’re cold — november , the streets icy and everyone you pass homeless , goodwill coats and hefty bags torn up to make ponchos — someone is always at the pay phone , hunched over the receiver spewing winter’s germs , swollen lipped , face chapped , making the last tired connection of the day . you keep walking to keep the cold at bay , too cold to wait for the bus , too depressing the thought of entering that blue light , the chilled eyes watching you decide which seat to take : the man with one leg , his crutches bumping the smudged window glass , the woman with her purse clutched to her breasts like a dead child , the boy , pimpled , morose , his head shorn , a swastika carved into the stubble , staring you down . so you walk into the cold you know : the wind , indifferent blade , familiar , the gold leaves heaped along the gutters . you have a home , a house with gas heat , a toilet that flushes . you have a credit card , cash . you could take a taxi if one would show up . you can feel it now : why people become republicans : get that dog off the street . remove that spit and graffiti . arrest those people huddled on the steps of the church .

"i've been suicidal for about 5 years now , and all i have been thinking about is how good heaven would be , how happy i would be , prancing along in the clouds with my denim overalls with no - show socks with my dad , who died of cancer when i was three . i seriously want to die so badly , but i am thinking about how much guilt would be on my shoulders with my mom . she cares about me so much , almost too much , and if she saw me dead , she would kill herself too , because she says that i am her life and if i was gone , she would be gone , and i do not want that for her because she has tons of friends and has a great life with a great job . all of those fake emos that say "" im depressed "" and "" i want to die "" are so annoying because i can tell if it is the truth and if its not because fake people say that they want to die and go on with their day , but real people say that they want to die and keep talking about it and keep going . i hate my life as is , and it only gets worse when people ask me "" what do you do for fun ? "" and i just say nothing because i do not do anything other than be on my game talking to people online . i have seriously put thought into this , and everybody thinks that its just a phase and it is really not . therapists are passed around like poker chips , and none of them really help with anything . i think about a month before my birthday , ( april ) i will finally end it . my mom always wants me to get off the games , but she does not understand that the only reason that i am on them is because the internet is the only place i feel free to do whatever i want and play whatever i want with whoever i want and actually have a good life on the internet , and when i get grounded , i just sit there , thinking about good dates to plan my suicide . honestly , i do not think i will make it through june 2021 , but i feel like i should not because i jsut do not feel like i should exist , like i am a bug in the system that need to be fixed , but i cannot be fixed , because this is who i am , and nobody can change that . i always get ghosted , and i am the weird kid in class that doen't belong . i think this is my last post on reddit before my suicide , and i just wanted to wish everybody a grateful goodbye , you guys have been so supportive with everything , and i love reddit . thank you for reading . this is a message for everybody else on this subreddit . do not kill yourself . let it wait out a coupe of months and if you still want to , i am not stopping you . just wait a couple months . it gets better . unfortunately , i wasnt so lucky with this . i was supposed to commit suicide . thank you all for reading this , and i hope you have a good life . thanks .

"we thought it would come , we thought the germans would come , were almost certain they would . i was thirty - two , the youngest assistant curator in the country . i had some good ideas in those days . well , what we did was this . we had boxes precisely built to every size of canvas . we put the boxes in the basement and waited . when word came that the germans were coming in , we got each painting put in the proper box and out of leningrad in less than a week . they were stored somewhere in southern russia . but what we did , you see , besides the boxes waiting in the basement , which was fine , a grand idea , you’ll agree , and it saved the art — but what we did was leave the frames hanging , so after the war it would be a simple thing to put the paintings back where they belonged . nothing will seem surprised or sad again compared to those imperious , vacant frames . well , the staff stayed on to clean the rubble after the daily bombardments . we didn’t dream — you know it lasted nine hundred days . much of the roof was lost and snow would lie sometimes a foot deep on this very floor , but the walls stood firm and hardly a frame fell . here is the story , now , that i want to tell you . early one day , a dark december morning , we came on three young soldiers waiting outside , pacing and swinging their arms against the cold . they told us this : in three homes far from here all dreamed of one day coming to leningrad to see the hermitage , as they supposed every soviet citizen dreamed of doing . now they had been sent to defend the city , a turn of fortune the three could hardly believe . i had to tell them there was nothing to see but hundreds and hundreds of frames where the paintings had hung . “ please , sir , ” one of them said , “ let us see them . ” and so we did . it didn’t seem any stranger than all of us being here in the first place , inside such a building , strolling in snow . we led them around most of the major rooms , what they could take the time for , wall by wall . now and then we stopped and tried to tell them part of what they would see if they saw the paintings . i told them how those colors would come together , described a brushstroke here , a dollop there , mentioned a model and why she seemed to pout and why this painter got the roses wrong . the next day a dozen waited for us , then thirty or more , gathered in twos and threes . each of us took a group in a different direction : castagno , caravaggio , brueghel , cézanne , matisse , orozco , manet , da vinci , goya , vermeer , picasso , uccello , your whistler , wood , and gropper . we pointed to more details about the paintings , i venture to say , than if we had had them there , some unexpected use of line or light , balance or movement , facing the cluster of faces the same way we’d done it every morning before the war , but then we didn’t pay so much attention to what we talked about . people could see for themselves . as a matter of fact we’d sometimes said our lines as if they were learned out of a book , with hardly a look at the paintings . but now the guide and the listeners paid attention to everything — the simple differences between the first and post - impressionists , romantic and heroic , shade and shadow . maybe this was a way to forget the war a little while . maybe more than that . whatever it was , the people continued to come . it came to be called the unseen collection . here . here is the story i want to tell you . slowly , blind people began to come . a few at first then more of them every morning , some led and some alone , some swaying a little . they leaned and listened hard , they screwed their faces , they seemed to shift their eyes , those that had them , to see better what was being said . and a cock of the head . my god , they paid attention . after the siege was lifted and the germans left and the roof was fixed and the paintings were in their places , the blind never came again . not like before . this seems strange , but what i think it was , they couldn’t see the paintings anymore . they could still have listened , but the lectures became a little matter - of - fact . what can i say ? confluences come when they will and they go away .

"it's been a while since i had thoughts so nasty that i made me want to talk to someone . i just took 2 ( english & math ) out of 4 ( english , math , mt & science ) examinations before my final major exam before i leave primary school . while i still have the urge to cut myself with a knife , i try to refrain cutting so that i would remain unnoticeable in school . before i took the math paper , while we had our usual class , when i responded to a question , my form teacher gasped in surprise . she said that "" it's the first time i hear you talk for a long time , "" even though she had been my teacher for 2 years , it actually made me wonder how quiet i am ? while i still pretended to joke around with classmates and talked nonsense with them , i do not really talk other than that . only when i am asked questions do i reply . a lot of teachers have said that about me . well , i am worried . since the major exam is about 1 month away , i cannot help but worry . everytime i think about my grades , i always imagined . . . will i die then ? will i die after taking the exak ? will i kill myself when i get my results ? weirdly , i would smile or shed tears unconsciously when i thought about it . well , since i imagined it so much . . . maybe i really might die before i turn 13 . . . .

"acts of love have material effects . for a woman tending the sacred fire , these include the risk of becoming an extinguisher of flames essential to civic life . it is a burden to put out what others hold as central to faith in coherence . acts of faith have material effects — a vestal virgin touched by encounter must be buried alive , a beautiful metaphor for shame itself , which squirms even under all that dirt . thus , the dead learn too late that devotion should be unidirectional , a straight line from here to suffocation . love must not bleed at the edges , must not meet others in the banal spaces of civic life . it is a burden to personify . if vesta’s hearth is the site of the sacred , its material effects are destruction : burning , consumption , constant hunger for more wood . acts of destruction have fantasmatic effects . for a body surviving encounter , these include civic life , shame ; the risk of being a proxy — tender of the hearth belonging to the public , by way of the goddess , who embodies a dream of faith in coherence . material effects extinguish themselves , eventually , as when a woman touched in the correct way undoes the burden of love and puts out , taking the goddamn city in and under .

the morning after my death we will sit in cafés but i will not be there i will not be * there was the great death of birds the moon was consumed with fire the stars were visible until noon . green was the forest drenched with shadows the roads were serpentine a redwood tree stood alone with its lean and lit body unable to follow the cars that went by with frenzy a tree is always an immutable traveller . the moon darkened at dawn the mountain quivered with anticipation and the ocean was double - shaded : the blue of its surface with the blue of flowers mingled in horizontal water trails there was a breeze to witness the hour * the sun darkened at the fifth hour of the day the beach was covered with conversations pebbles started to pour into holes and waves came in like horses . * the moon darkened on christmas eve angels ate lemons in illuminated churches there was a blue rug planted with stars above our heads lemonade and war news competed for our attention our breath was warmer than the hills . * there was a great slaughter of rocks of spring leaves of creeks the stars showed fully the last king of the mountain gave battle and got killed . we lay on the grass covered dried blood with our bodies green blades swayed between our teeth . * we went out to sea a bank of whales was heading south a young man among us a hero tried to straddle one of the sea creatures his body emerged as a muddy pool as mud we waved goodbye to his remnants happy not to have to bury him in the early hours of the day we got drunk in a barroom the small town of fairfax had just gone to bed cherry trees were bending under the weight of their flowers : they were involved in a ceremonial dance to which no one had ever been invited . * i know flowers to be funeral companions they make poisons and venoms and eat abandoned stone walls i know flowers shine stronger than the sun their eclipse means the end of times but i love flowers for their treachery their fragile bodies grace my imagination’s avenues without their presence my mind would be an unmarked grave . * we met a great storm at sea looked back at the rocking cliffs the sand was going under black birds were leaving the storm ate friends and foes alike water turned into salt for my wounds . * flowers end in frozen patterns artificial gardens cover the floors we get up close to midnight search with powerful lights the tiniest shrubs on the meadows a stream desperately is running to the ocean * ,0,,,1518

"foreword to “ dancing on the grave of a son of a bitch ” this poem is more properly a “ dance poem ” than a song or chant because the element of repetition is created by movements of language rather than duplicating words and sounds . however , it is in the spirit of ritual recitation that i wrote it / a performance to drive away bad spirits perhaps . the story behind the poem is this : a man and woman who have been living together for some time separate . part of the pain of separation involves possessions which they had shared . they both angrily believe they should have what they want . she asks for some possession and he denies her the right to it . she replies that she gave him money for a possession which he has and therefore should have what she wants now . he replies that she has forgotten that for the number of years they lived together he never charged her rent and if he had she would now owe him $ 7 , 000 . she is appalled that he equates their history with a sum of money . she is even more furious to realize that this sum of money represents the entire rent on the apartment and implies that he should not have paid anything at all . she is furious . she kills him mentally . once and for all she decides she is well rid of this man and that she shouldn’t feel sad at their parting . she decides to prove to herself that she’s glad he’s gone from her life . with joy she will dance on all the bad memories of their life together . for my motorcycle betrayer god damn it , at last i am going to dance on your grave , old man ; you’ve stepped on my shadow once too often , you’ve been unfaithful to me with other women , women so cheap and insipid it psychs me out to think i might ever be put in the same category with them ; you’ve left me alone so often that i might as well have been a homesteader in alaska these past years ; and you’ve left me , thrown me out of your life often enough that i might as well be a newspaper , differently discarded each day . now you’re gone for good and i don’t know why but your leaving actually made me as miserable as an earthworm with no earth , but now i’ve crawled out of the ground where you stomped me and i gradually stand taller and taller each day . i have learned to sing new songs , and as i sing , i’m going to dance on your grave because you are dead dead dead under the earth with the rest of the shit , i’m going to plant deadly nightshade on your grassy mound and make sure a hemlock tree starts growing there . henbane is too good for you , but i’ll let a bit grow there for good measure because we want to dance , we want to sing , we want to throw this old man to the wolves , but they are too beautiful for him , singing in harmony with each other . so some white wolves and i will sing on your grave , old man and dance for the joy of your death . “ is this an angry statement ? ” “ no , it is a statement of joy . ” “ will the sun shine again ? ” "" yes , yes , yes , ” because i’m going to dance dance dance duncan’s measure , and pindar’s tune , lorca’s cadence , and creeley’s hum , stevens’ sirens and williams’ little morris dance , oh , the poets will call the tune , and i will dance , dance , dance on your grave , grave , grave , because you’re a sonofabitch , a sonofabitch , and you tried to do me in , but you cannot cant cant . you were a liar in a way that only i know : you ride a broken motorcycle , you speak a dead language you are a bad plumber , and you write with an inkless pen . you were mean to me , and i’ve survived , god damn you , at last i am going to dance on your grave , old man , i’m going to learn every traditional dance , every measure , and dance dance dance on your grave one step for every time you done me wrong .

"this poem is essentially about life and death . what is clear about this particular poem , compared to most poetry , is that through the voice of the speaker the reader can feel the emotions and thoughts of the author flattening down into points that come across as very personal to delight and sadden the younger readers of today . in almost all other poetry there is a “ speaker ” who goes upward and upward , a machine that absorbs vibration from bigger machines but if it happens here now , in this poem will there be anyone nearby who wants to see ? maybe the dead know how to live more fully , torches turned down but still fuming like rinds around hot marshmallows do , their divided subject matter focused primarily on dark imagery with symbols of light inside — i never understood the big whoop about demeter : reading is already a giant supplanting . a new reader discovers this work while he is leaving flowers where his dead bride used to be . but it enables him to be reborn again each time — persephone is not the unhappy one moving up the dark stairs she considers in her consciousness as light while the poem commences and commences like the days dividing summer from its students , sponges that sway in an undersea film until the poem spreads , and reaches its conclusion that students are each taught to believe in things differently : that persephone was a goddess who was abducted by pluto , the author himself a blue web that exists years and years after his death stuck inside the tired envelope of poetry who feels he finally is reading himself , the spring flowers intense and papery like they used to be , enabling the reader again to feel the darkness with a rhythm that enables the reader to almost see . was his conclusion merely a mistake , or did he intentionally use elements of different poems until he finally made his destination , from blue to smoking to flatten , september confused with its light ?

" “ you need professional support ” seems like a cop out and avoidance from anyone i try to talk to from trying to help . like i’m a ticking time bomb they don’t want to be responsible for . the issue is currently there isn’t really a treatment plan that exists that would do much . the professionals keep asking what i need - i’m so acutely unwell after the suicide of my partner of 7 years that how am i supposed to tell the professionals how to help ? mental health treatment takes a lot of giving from the patient and a lot of effort from the patient . even then it doesn’t always treat someone . the paradox is the more acutely unwell someone is the more difficult you will find it to treat them and have them respond to the care and engage . that’s why i know even though i’m so unwell i have to push myself to continue to engage because otherwise they may never help me because they couldn’t find out what was wrong and why i’m so intent on killing myself . i’m so passed the point of having the emotional energy to get or give what i need and fighting the people who tell me i need professional support when i’m trying so hard to have it . nobody wants to feel like this . because physical illness is treat and the patient can sit back and the recovery will come on its own from antibiotics , physio or operations . in mental health there isn’t that . the patient has to constantly be making effort to make themselves better and putting energy into making them selves okay . mental health treatment is only guided by the professionals . if they can’t even put a tiny plan in for me to work with that isn’t art therapy with people i don’t know and i’m not ready for then what are they supposed to be doing to actually help other than when i’m in crisis assessing me and putting me in hospital . there’s no prevention . i ask for help . but people have expectations that once someone is in “ professional ” hands that they will be fixed and if they’re not it’s obviously not the professionals being inadequate - it’s me not trying and engaging .

"hello everyone i do not know where to start but i have lived through some pretty very serious and constant emotional trauma and neglect as a child up to my teenager years . when i decided to leave the environment by that time there was nothing left of my soul , it had been completely and utterly destroyed . i am 21 now , almost 22 and i do not feel human anymore and i am disconnected from my emotions but at the same time i love and appreciate life even if i cannot feel the full range of emotions anymore , anyway . i was and am completely alone and i have realised i must rely on my own strength and will power for me to survive . i've always been trying to improve myself and be better everyday . i workout , eat healthy , i am a university student and i am going to therapy and psychiatrist for years because i want to be better but there is also a downside because i also used to use alcohol and other drugs to self medicate during the worst periods of my life . i have blacked out countless of times and was an alcoholic for awhile ( there is a part of me that wants self destruct ) but i managed to kick it without any help from anyone ( or so i thought ) . i've been sober from alcohol for 5 months now but last night i blacked out when i was drinking with my friend . i do not remember what happened but he kicked me out of his house or i was an idiot and decided to leave . i do not know if i threatened him or if i was being an asshole or whatever but i know it was bad . i woke up today and i absolutely hate and disgusted with myself because no matter how much i try to better myself and live a good life , there is something in my core that is just broken with the centre being a black hole . i almost always feel empty inside even though objectively i know there is meaning in my life and things have been going good for me lately but i just cannot feel it . i am suffering from the trauma and abuse everyday one way or another and i am in a lot pain and suffering in my mind especially when it comes to relationships with people and thats why when i blackout i might hurt someone even though i do not want to hurt anybody . i am a pacifist . i have dreams and aspirations i know i have the ability and mindset to be successful , i want a family i want kids but this black hole inside of me sabatouges every good thing that comes into my life . every day and night there is a never ending struggle for suicide for years . i cannot take this anymore , i want to live but not like this and i am starting to believe death is the only solution because i just want all of my suffering to end and maybe i can finally find some peace . i know for a fact if i had an a gun i would pull the trigger without a second thought . i do not want to hurt anyone else anymore with my actions and i know the people i have effected wont see this but i am sorry for everything ive done and all the pain i have caused . that person wasnt the real me i hope you can understand that . i want to be a good person but when i drink and blackout i am such an asshole and terrible to people . my actions completely contradict my own personal beliefs . its everything i stand against . when i look at myself in the mirror i feel disgusted",1,,,5452

"we have the whole evening ahead of us , we think , our eyesight starting to weaken , we must have missed the houselights growing dim , but how could that moment have escaped us when the roots of the paper trees struck water and transformed themselves into the real thing — this nervous wood at the edge of a small , provincial town whose still lifes waken to find that they’re portraits after all and subject to the risk of animation ? tonight we may discuss — after the chopin nocturnes , after the i - don’t - know - how - many performances of beethoven’s “ moonlight ” sonata — the gradual reduction of roman columns , the disease of too many lakes and clouds . do cobblestones have a future ? is rain removable ? depressing mornings find characters in bed who have no reason to get up , the light a yellowish half - light mirroring the mind , its sad affections . at the lake , a flat of faultless summer is being taken down , the view abandoned ; the puzzled players change their places . once you might have found them walking in an orchard , the blossoms opening their mouths to speak and song occurring as if it were natural ; now that trees uproot themselves and bankrupt agriculture wanes in its drying furrows , property and battlefields turn out to share a fate in common — they exchange hands . shrines “ fallen out of the perpendicular , ” stones “ that have apparently once been tombstones ” — we are on someone’s estate not far from moscow . how simply the sun goes out like a match ! how deeply the wounds stay on the surface ! he said the best that can be said for property : it lets an old man fall in love with landscape , lets so many trees have a chance to be noticed , allows the self - interested birds to preen , until the property is lost again . to an upstart creditor who sells the trees for lumber , then , to the sounds of saws , tramps through the hallway in his dirty boots to explain , in tears , the dreary motivation : his mother’s dying , his young wife’s in love with a boor . . . the babel of trouble starts ; among all the hells that go on talking , only one is real , though it is silent , and everything leads up to it — to lose the land , to lose the very ground you stand on . if the temporary brilliancies gather once more in the middle distance , and the modal lark persuades the summer evening to reveal one private little splendor not for sale , still , a gunshot , onstage or off , tells us what no one is prepared to know : love is a tourniquet tightening its bands around the slowly dying wrist of freedom , futility’s a spinster bending over a book of household accounts forever . bathed in the acid of truth , all things become possible : to be a cold snake at an interview , to live on scraps of soap to keep oneself warm , to resemble a cat constantly stalking the shadow of nothing , to the horse’s clop - clop outside the window , or the sound of a guitar from a neighboring room , the doctor , with a smile , asks , what is man ? a hero about to be done - in for good ? a villain about to be rescued by pain ? the governess is wearing her old forage cap . that’s epihodov playing his guitar . astrov is talking about trees . we could be racing the wolves at thirty below in a ravine whiplashed by snow , or slowly succumbing to boredom in a seaside town , waiting for a future that will never be , the heat getting worse , far off the waves pounding faintly late in the moonlight , at a low moment in our lives .

"i’ve been depressed since i was 7 years old . i’m 21 now . i’ve been suicidal for that same time as well . i’m still living at home because school is my first priority and my mom is “ nice ” enough to let me stay until i can graduate and get a stable job . my room is not kept . it’s messy . i don’t have the energy to take care of it because i hate myself just as much . my cat’s litter box pushes out clean litter ( it’s one of those self cleaning ones that pushes it to a different compartment ) . so i took my detachable vacuum to it to suck up the litter crystals that fell on the floor . my vacuum wasn’t working . it wasn’t sucking up the litter . so i texted my mom to see if she could get it working again . i was actively trying to clean my room . i have been trying for the last few days . but i have no drive . she doesn’t understand this . she busted into my room and angrily took the vacuum from me . she looked at his litter and said “ this is fucking disgusting . does your boyfriend know you live like this ? ” he does . becuase i tell him about my depression , lack of eating and drinking water , and lack of cleaning my room . he knows it’s a problem . but he’s never mad at me because of it . he has depression too . he understands . she keeps screaming at me about how disgusting i am and how i’m a hoarder . i’m not a hoarder . i just donated 2 overfilled bags of clothes to good will a couple days ago . i put new sheets on my bed . i washed all of my clothes . i have a big bag of trash that i was going to take down to the garbage can with the old litter i was replacing . i started to cry because i hate being yelled at . i break down . i was in an abusive relationship last year and so whenever anyone yells at me , i don’t know what to do . she did “ stop that shit . knock it the fuck off . you’re a hoarder and that’s disgusting . ” i’m not a hoarder . i promise i’m not a hoarder . i just hate myself too much . when i have the drive to clean , i do . but she never notices . when she left my room , in order to not hurt myself like i usually do when she yells at me , i called my boyfriend so i could calm down . i told him “ i have to be quiet . she’ll hear me . my mom just yelled at me and i don’t feel like i’m in the right state of mind right now - “ and then i jumped when she opened my door . she said “ don’t be a fucking snitch . don’t be a fucking tattletale . clean up this shit right fucking now . does he know you live like this ? ” the only thing i could think in my head is ‘yeah , he does . he knows it’s bad . but he knows i’ve been doing good these past few days in trying to clean it’ . but i knew that if i told my mom this , she’d get even more angry at me . when she walked out again , i hurt myself pretty bad . i couldn’t deal with it . i was harm free for a few months . the last time i hurt myself was in early july . i was doing so well . i didn’t know what to do anymore . i’m currently locked in my room and the thoughts are really intrusive at the moment . it’s been an hour but i still can’t calm down . i’m panicking right now . i have tourette’s syndrome and she would yell at me when i would tic uncontrollably . i learned to suppress it so she wouldn’t be mad at me anymore . when i tell her about how i hurt myself or that i’m suicidal or have depression , she says “ call a therapist and set up an appointment ” . i don’t have health insurance now so even going to a therapist is out of the question . . . she never offers words of encouragement . she doesn’t tell me things are going to be okay . she doesn’t know how bad my depression has gotten or how long i’ve been depressed for . being depressed for 14 years . . . she won’t believe it because i act happy around her . she gets mad when i tell her these things . the only reason i’m alive right now is that i’m too scared to die and i care about my boyfriend too much to leave him . it’s really bad . i’m not a hoarder . i just hate myself too much to live well . i’m trying to calm down as best as i can . my room is still locked so she won’t come in . i don’t know what to do right now . i don’t want to be a burden on my boyfriend . but now i’m overwhelmed with my room . i took down the trash , took care of the litter , but now i can’t vacuum because the suction isn’t working . she’s going to be so mad at me . i really want to leave , but i have no money . and she’ll get mad if i go to my boyfriend’s house to get away from this and calm down . . .

"when i was a kid ( i mean pre teen ) i used to crave being 15 / 18 years old because i thought it would be so cool , and that’s understandable because tv series influenced me ; now that i’m 17 everything is way way worse and i wish i was still in elementary school where i felt hopeful , happy and was surrounded by friends : ’ ) some time ago i used to dream of being in my 30s already , thinking i’d accomplish something by that age and would be pretty stable , but living now is a chore and it’s insanely difficult , it doesn’t get better , it truly never does . i had a thing i used to love but somehow it exploded and now it’s my worst fear , literally . i realized i really don’t feel like living . i even tried new religious beliefs ( used to be an atheist , now i kinda believe in the existence of god and satan and personally agree more with lucifer ) but it doesn’t help me at all , it does feel sort of exciting but . . . . i keep suffering from terrible anxiety and that takes away all the fun . lots of things have been ruined to me because of traumas , i now fear instagram , youtube and alcohol . i used to spend everyday on those two social platforms but now even mentioning them gets my stomach upside down because of something horrible that happened just recently . i can’t do anything . there is nothing i enjoy , literally . maybe reading fanfictions but i read them fast and waiting for an update makes my anxiety take over my body , i need my mind to be busy . everything makes me think of those traumas , nothing ever helps . i need medicines , i’d prefer feeling like a zombie than this shit . i don’t want advice on stuff to try or do because i’m hopeless , i just needed to vent .

"the flowering sea and the mountains in the moon’s waning the great stone close to the barbary figs and the asphodels the jar that refused to go dry at the end of day and the closed bed by the cypress trees and your hair golden ; the stars of the swan and that other star , aldebaran . i’ve kept a rein on my life , kept a rein on my life , travelling among yellow trees in driving rain on silent slopes loaded with beech leaves , no fire on their peaks ; it’s getting dark . i’ve kept a rein on my life ; on your left hand a line a scar at your knee , perhaps they exist on the sand of the past summer perhaps they remain there where the north wind blew as i hear an alien voice around the frozen lake . the faces i see do not ask questions nor does the woman bent as she walks giving her child the breast . i climb the mountains ; dark ravines ; the snow - covered plain , into the distance stretches the snow - covered plain , they ask nothing neither time shut up in dumb chapels nor hands outstretched to beg , nor the roads . i’ve kept a rein on my life whispering in a boundless silence i no longer know how to speak nor how to think ; whispers like the breathing of the cypress tree that night like the human voice of the night sea on pebbles like the memory of your voice saying ‘happiness’ . i close my eyes looking for the secret meeting - place of the waters under the ice the sea’s smile , the closed wells groping with my veins for those veins that escape me there where the water - lilies end and that man who walks blindly across the snows of silence . i’ve kept a rein on my life , with him , looking for the water that touches you heavy drops on green leaves , on your face in the empty garden , drops in the motionless reservoir striking a swan dead in its white wings living trees and your eyes riveted . this road has no end , has no relief , however hard you try to recall your childhood years , those who left , those lost in sleep , in the graves of the sea , however much you ask bodies you’ve loved to stoop under the harsh branches of the plane trees there where a ray of the sun , naked , stood still and a dog leapt and your heart shuddered , the road has no relief ; i’ve kept a rein on my life . the snow and the water frozen in the hoofmarks of the horses .

the veiled shape is a grandmother to the young boys working beside her — packing stones from the field on the journey toward subsistence . above them the hindu kush disappears behind storm clouds the color of milk in a metal pail . the grandfather is grinding blades the way time sharpens distrust — the stones fall from the mountains all winter — almost always at night — the sound of them ganging up on starlight leaves a musical note like jostled skewers . there’s nothing militant here unless the noise of a shovel is the voice of heresy — the missile enters the poem the way a horse defecates on an ant colony simply because everything is where it is when shit happens — if i were writing this poem i’d ignore the falcon hunting what small life escapes the heat signature because it’s pushed by million - year - old imperatives and unlike us it has no off switch . this is where the poem fails — where all literature fails — to thirst sufficiently to drink the last drip from the cold faucet attached to the executioner’s heart . ,0,,,1076
"i’ve been thinking about this for years but always been too scared to actually act on it , but now’s looking like the time . & # x200b ; i’m autistic . when i was diagnosed at age four my father decided he no longer wanted much to do with my upbringing and so he fucked off down the pub most nights . he eventually wanted to try again with another kid and by the time he came back and my sibling was born he dedicated a lot of time towards them and pretty much ignored my existence , or shouted at me for things beyond my control . i was enrolled in some sort of therapy that tried to get me to act like a normal kid which worked for a while but then i started regressing and beating myself up over my failures to act normally . & # x200b ; in school things were even worse . my classroom assistant physically and emotionally abused me to the point where i developed ptsd traits and spoke of wanting to kill myself aged 9 . i had a slab of wood under my bed that i’d found and started to hurt myself with it . she encouraged the other kids to bully me ; i’d try and laugh it off but then they’d say “ we’re not laughing with you we’re laughing at you ” . she would drag me out of my classroom for fidgeting , not making eye contact , or talking too much about my favourite video games . i learned to conform and shut up , and would suck the backs of my hands until they bled . & # x200b ; then in high school i was completely ostracised and literally had no friends whatsoever . my teachers hated me , my classmates thought i was strange . one day coming home on the bus i was beaten up by a group of kids and neither the bus driver nor the older students raised any alarms . i tried to kill myself at home that night . i was 15 . i failed , and when i got downstairs my father had just come home , demanding to know why i’d forgotten to lock the door , pushing me into the fridge . i am 21 now but last year he attempted to smother me . ( for those of you wondering why i haven’t moved out , i’m a university student and had come home for the summer when this happened ) & # x200b ; this year in lockdown things were equally bad , i had to return home as my university was closed and the whole time i’ve been here i’ve been shouted at , had things thrown at me , etc . & # x200b ; for as long as i can remember i’ve known i was weird and unusual and that those things were inherently bad . from a young age i would tell my teachers and parents that when i grow up , i would like to be normal . i still wish i was . if there was anything i could do to change the way my brain works i would do it . be like everyone else . be able to tolerate wearing certain fabrics , not freak out at loud sounds . . . but i will never be normal . there is no cure for what i have . all i know is that it’s not right , that it’s something that’s wrong with me . & # x200b ; and that maybe people like me are predestined to leave this world early . i read that most of us die by suicide by the age of 39 . and maybe that’s the way i’ve got to go , too . i’ve been burdensome to everyone in my life - my teachers , the kids who had to pretend and force themselves to be friends with me , and even my own family who had to whisk me off to psychologist appointments half the time . & # x200b ; half the time i don’t even feel like i deserve to be recognised as a person . i’m too different . defective , if you will . completely cut off from society , and at odds with it . & # x200b ; i get on well with my mother , but i wish i could’ve been the kid she wanted . someone that was gonna grow up , get married , have kids , and a job . i have no interest in marriage or having children and have been rejected from multiple interviews . i also don’t have typical interests and dress in loose fitting , boring , dare i say typically nerdy clothing . i don’t think she’ll be too upset if i go . & # x200b ; anyway there’s probably a lot i’ve missed but i’m just wondering if there’s any point holding out hope when i know full well that it’s time for me to go and the sooner i go , the better .

"1 one day the amarous lisander , by an impatient passion sway'd , surpris'd fair cloris , that lov'd maid , who cou'd defend her self no longer ; all things did with his love conspire , the gilded planet of the day , in his gay chariot , drawn by fire , was now descending to the sea , and left no light to guide the world , but what from cloris brighter eyes was hurl'd . 2 in alone thicket , made for love , silent as yielding maids consent , she with a charming languishment permits his force , yet gently strove ? her hands his bosom softly meet , but not to put him back design'd , rather to draw him on inclin'd , whilst he lay trembling at her feet ; resistance 'tis to late to shew , she wants the pow'r to say — ah ! what do you do ? 3 her bright eyes sweat , and yet severe , where love and shame confus'dly strive , fresh vigor to lisander give : and whispring softly in his ear , she cry'd — cease — cease — your vain desire , or i will call out — what wou'd you do ? my dearer honour , ev'n to you , i cannot — must not give — retire , or take that life whose chiefest part i gave you with the conquest of my heart . 4 but he as much unus'd to fear , as he was capable of love , the blessed minutes to improve , kisses her lips , her neck , her hair ! each touch her new desires alarms ! his burning trembling hand he prest upon her melting snowy breast , while she lay panting in his arms ! all her unguarded beauties lie the spoils and trophies of the enemy . 5 and now , without respect or fear , he seeks the objects of his vows ; his love no modesty allows : by swift degrees advancing where his daring hand that alter seiz'd , where gods of love do sacrifice ; that awful throne , that paradise , where rage is tam'd , and anger pleas'd ; that living fountain , from whose trills the melted soul in liquid drops distils . 6 her balmy lips encountring his , their bodies as their souls are joyn'd , where both in transports were confin'd , extend themselves upon the moss . cloris half dead and breathless lay , her eyes appear'd like humid light , such as divides the day and night ; or falling stars , whose fires decay ; and now no signs of life she shows , but what in short - breath - sighs returns and goes . 7 he saw how at her length she lay , he saw her rising bosom bare , her loose thin r obes , through which appear a shape design'd for love and play ; abandon'd by her pride and shame , she do's her softest sweets dispence , offring her virgin - innocence a victim to loves sacred flame ; whilst th' or'e ravish'd shepherd lies , unable to perform the sacrifice . 8 ready to taste a thousand joys , thee too transported hapless swain , found the vast pleasure turn'd to pain : pleasure , which too much love destroys ! the willing garments by he laid , and heav'n all open to his view ; mad to possess , himself he threw on the defenceless lovely maid . but oh ! what envious gods conspire to snatch his pow'r , yet leave him the desire ! 9 natures support , without whose aid she can no humane being give , it self now wants the art to live , faintness it slacken'd nerves invade : in vain th' enraged youth assaid to call his fleeting vigour back , no motion 'twill from motion take , excess of love his love betray'd ; in vain he toils , in vain commands , th' insensible fell weeping in his hands . 10 in this so am'rous cruel strife , where love and fate were too severe , the poor lisander in despair , renounc'd his reason with his life . now all the brisk and active fire that should the nobler part inflame , unactive frigid , dull became , and left no spark for new desire ; not all her naked charms cou'd move , or calm that rage that had debauch'd his love . 11 cloris returning from the trance which love and soft desire had bred , her tim'rous hand she gently laid , or guided by design or chance , upon that fabulous priapus , that potent god ( as poets feign . ) but never did young shepherdess ( gath'ring of fern upon the plain ) more nimbly draw her fingers back , finding beneath the verdant leaves a snake . 12 then cloris her fair hand withdrew , finding that god of her desires disarm'd of all his pow'rful fires , and cold as flow'rs bath'd in the morning - dew . who can the nymphs confusion guess ? the blood forsook the kinder place , and strew'd with blushes all her face , which both disdain and shame express ; and from lisanders arms she fled , leaving him fainting on the gloomy bed . 13 like lightning through the grove she hies , or daphne from the delphick god ; no print upon the grassie road she leaves , t' instruct pursuing eyes . the wind that wanton'd in her hair , and with her ruffled garments plaid , discover'd in the flying maid all that the gods e're made of fair . so venus , when her love was slain , with fear and haste flew o're the fatal plain . 14 the nymphs resentments , none but i can well imagin , and condole ; but none can guess lisander 's soul , but those who sway'd his destiny : his silent griefs , swell up to storms , and not one god , his fury spares , he curst his birth , his fate , his stars , but more the shepherdesses charms ; whose soft bewitching influence , had damn'd him to the hell of impotence .

"so to sum it up , i have had suicidal thoughts since i was in 8th grade and i’m 22 now and like a month and a half ago i finally started a med that made them go away but i’m super manic and just over the top happy and am so worried about literally everything and talk to everyone i see . it’s like . . . the “ happiest ” i’ve been since 8th grade but it’s a fake happiness and i’m trying to get it figured out with the doctor . anyway , the thoughts - gone . except they aren’t ? like in the back of my mind , now that i have totally convinced everyone that i don’t think about killing myself anymore , i could do it . i have one way my head is stuck on . i want to do it because my head wants me to do it . i have like two parts to my head . . . the part that’s like “ just do it . to die would bring you peace . ” and the other part is like “ yeah but you’d have to wait for this or that and you don’t want to die . ” but i do want to die ? but also , i don’t want to put my family through it . . it’s literally a constant fight and i don’t even know how to explain it correctly . does this make any sense ? do people get what i’m trying to say ? does anyone else have the two parts in their head ? mine are very distinct like they’re fighting and it just never stops . i don’t hear voices but there’s just two sides to what is going on in my brain .

"the curtains part : it is a summer’s day . there a cow on a grassy slope watches as a bull charges an old aeroplane in a meadow . the bull is punching holes with its horns in the aeroplane’s fabric . . . suddenly the aeroplane’s engine ignites ; the meadow is dark blue smoke . . . the aeroplane shifts round and faces the charging bull . as the bull comes in the propeller takes off the end of its muzzle . the bloody nostrils , a ring through them , are flung to the grass with a shattered blossom of teeth . the bull , blood oozing from the stump of its face , backs off , and charges again . this time the propeller catches the bull behind its lower jaw and flings the head into a tree . the headless bull backs off once more , and then charges down again . the propeller beating at the headless bull , cutting the body away in a great halo of blood , until only the back legs are standing . these run widely away through the meadow in figure eights and zigzags , until at last they find the aeroplane again . and as they come running down the propeller whacks them apart . the legs , one with the tail still attached to it , the other somehow retaining both rectum and testicles , scamper off in opposite directions . the aeroplane turns away ; the engine stops . the shadows are suddenly seen in lengthened form . the watching cow begins to low . . .
