"ghost of a girl “ i hate it when we have visitors . ” elodie and simon stood under the branches of a giant oak watching tourists traipsing through the grounds toward the creek . “ it was father’s dream , ” said simon . “ yes , well , in this case i feel he was misguided . ” elodie sunk to the ground and arranged the layers of her skirt around her . simon sat as well and stretched out his long legs . “ you know as well as i do , ” said elodie , “ that people couldn’t care less about the house . they all want to see where it happened . how many years have to pass before the story fades away ? ” “ it will never die , ” said simon tugging at the grass . “ it’s become urban legend now . whether the story was true or not . ” “ sometimes if you tell a story often enough it becomes true , ” said elodie . she turned her head toward simon . “ where would you live if you didn’t have to live here ” ? simon lifted his chin and closed his eyes giving the question consideration . “ i think i’d go to canada , ” he said . “ why on earth for ? ” asked elodie . “ it’s freezing there . ” “ i don’t know , ” said simon , shrugging his shoulders , “ adventure ? where would you go ? ” “ i’d go to france , ” sighed elodie . “ not paris . maybe provence . i’d live in a stone house near a vineyard and take long romantic walks with my lover pierre while we sipped wine made from our own grapes . ” simon laughed . “ i envy you your vivid imagination . ” “ it does help sometimes . do you want to go closer ? ” elodie asked . “ sure , why not , ” replied simon . they rose and went silently through the trees until they were within earshot of the tour group . a small gathering stood around the guide in rapt attention . “ he must be getting to the good part , ” whispered simon . elodie smirked . they’d both heard the story hundreds of times . “ in the year 1912 the patterson family inherited the main house from joseph patterson who was instrumental in bringing the patterson publishing company to the area . joseph began the business as a small printing company that was housed in one of the outbuildings you see to the left of the main house . we’ll be touring those momentarily . but before we do , i’d like to draw your attention to the creek that runs alongside the property . legend has it that patterson’s eldest daughter fell in and was accidentally drowned and that if you were to lean over the edge and look into the water you may still see the dress she was wearing float to the surface . ” the guide paused for effect . “ does anyone wish to try ? ” he asked . a couple of brave souls stepped forward to peer into the stream and looked up , relieved , when they saw nothing but the greenish water drifting along . “ it’s been said , ” continued the guide that she walks the halls of the patterson house and grounds looking for her family . many people claimed to have seen her . "" the crowd mumbled and shivered and looked over their shoulders in spite of themselves . the guide led the group up the incline toward the printing house . elodie and simon stayed where they were and moved to the water’s edge . the little stream drifted along peacefully . “ it doesn’t seem very dangerous , does it ? ” mused elodie . “ no , not really , ” agreed simon . “ but i hate it when they forget to tell the other part . how her brother tried to save her and drowned too . ” “ they’ll remember next time , ” said elodie smiling gently . “ would it make you feel better to make an appearance ? ” simon nodded , grinning . “ attic stairs or cellar ? ” she asked . “ cellar , i think . might as well give the people their money’s worth . ” ",0,0204fd9e-90cc-4751-ae6d-e5be480e674b,0,0.9999977350234985,0.99733573,0,0.99984014,0,1,0.99984014,0.99984014,0

"the detective crossed travis street then turned right onto addison road , he could see several hundred yards up the street that there was a police cordon in place as he was approaching it he could see dozens of neighbours loitering around the cordon and to his chagrin there was even a sat - truck . the deputies closing the road saw him coming they opened the cordon and waved him through , he drove another hundred yards then parked behind a row of police cruisers and ambulances he got out of his car then began walking towards the crime scene . the detective started closing on a group of deputies and paramedics . ‘detective . ’ said one of the deputies turning to greet him . ‘boy are we glad you’re here . ’ the deputy looked to the ground when he looked back up he was visibly upset . ‘we have three dea . . . one of them . . one - ‘ ‘it’s ok . ’ said detective harrison , he put his hand on the man’s shoulder . ‘take a deep breath . ’ the deputy inhaled deeply he then said . ‘one of the victims was the responding officer he was my friend . . . sir we have a fucking madman on our hands it’s the devil only a demon could do this . ’ ‘we will get the bastard . ’ reassured detective harrison , he handed the deputy his keys for his car . ‘take a break go sit in my cruiser . ’ detective harrison continued on he saw crime scene investigators in white suits taking pictures he also saw dr fletcher she spotted him too they made a beeline for each other . ‘detective . ’ said dr fletcher . ‘has your captain been informed yet ? ’ ‘i called him he is on his way . ’ replied detective harrison . ‘i don’t think he should be here . ’ stated the doctor , she looked deeply concerned . ‘why ? ’ asked the detective . ‘he is the commander of homicide he needs to be here . ’ ‘well that’s the thing . ’ said dr fletcher . ‘the first responder was deputy gerald talbert he’s the captains nephew . ’ ‘oh fucking hell . ’ swore detective harrison , he pulled out his mobile phone and dialled the captains number it rang out then went to voicemail . ‘when the captain gets here you don’t let him through the cordon and you call for me you got it ? ’ ‘how ? ’ asked one of the deputies with an incredulous look . ‘he is ranking officer . ’ ‘his brothers boy has been killed . ’ said the detective , he gestured to the medical examiner . ‘he is lying over there dead , i am not going to let the man’s last image of his nephew be seeing his mutilated corpse got it ? ’ ‘got it , sir . ’ answered the deputy . ‘here take my phone . ’ he handed the officer his mobile . ‘keep trying him . ’ detective harrison then walked back over to the medical examiner . ‘what we got ? ’ ‘you better see for yourself . ’ replied dr fletcher , she gestured for him to follow . they closed with the abandoned police cruiser and lying in front of it was a body covered with a silver foil blanket . the medical examiner pulled the foil blanket down showing that the officer had nearly been split in two . ‘the poor boy . ’ said the detective . ‘that’s not all of it . ’ stated dr fletcher . ‘it looks like the killer taunted the police response time . ’ detective harrison’s faced screwed up in confusion . ‘what do you mean have we spoken with the killer ? ’ ‘no , detective . ’ said dr fletcher , she then took the foil blanket off completely . ‘but the killer left a message . ’ detective harrison felt his gorge rise in his throat as he saw what the medical examiner meant . looping out of the fallen officers stomach were his intestines like coils of sausages . the murderer had left a gruesome message for them written in the officers intestines was two words “ too late ! ” the sick bastard had even taken the time to roll up part of the man’s guts into a ball for the point of the exclamation mark . the detective had to look away he looked behind him and saw another foil blanket which was no doubt covering another body , there was a pool of blood that was leaking out from beneath the foil blanket . ‘whose under there ? ’ asked the detective , gesturing to the foil blanket . ‘half of the victim who prompted the 911 call . ’ replied dr fletcher ‘half ? ’ said the detective , he looked back to the medical examiner . ‘we are dealing with one sick bastard whose the ranking police officer here ? ’ dr fletcher gestured behind the detective he turned to see a sergeant walk out of the house that was part of the murder scene . as the sergeant was walking over the medical examiner recovered the fallen officers body . ‘sergeant webber . ’ said the man , holding out his hand . ‘detective harrison . ’ he shook the sergeants hand . ‘what you got so far ? ’ sergeant webber took a long look at the foil blanket covering the captains nephew then shook his head to clear it . ‘we got two 911 calls from the neighbours they were frantic talking about a man following someone down the street dragging an axe . ’ ‘officer talbert got the call he was told to assess the situation , from what we’ve pieced together from the neighbours he confronted the killer on the driveway . ’ the sergeant gestured to the foil blanket . ‘the killer was dragging half of one of the victims out the house , that’s when officer talbert intervened . ’ ‘it was a brave thing he did . ’ said detective harrison , he was trying to make the sergeant feel better but he also meant it . ‘we join the force to protect people , officer talbert gave his life to protect people without hesitation if only we could all follow his example . ’ ‘it was a brave thing . ’ agreed the sergeant . ‘i am just dreading facing his uncle or father . ’ ‘don’t worry about it i got that covered . ’ replied the detective , in a consoling expression . ‘i will let them know . ’ ‘thank you detective . ’ said the sergeant , he looked visibly relieved . ‘what else do you know about what happened here so far ? ’ asked detective harrison . ‘i have talked to the neighbours . ’ replied the sergeant , he gestured to the half of the man on the ground then to the open door of the house . ‘the man who was being followed tried to get into the house but he was locked out , right when the killer was about to take his head off the landlady ms peavey opened the door . ‘ms peavey took an axe to the face then we can only assume that the killer turned his attention to the original target , killing him by splitting him in half vertically . the neighbours saw the killer calmly dragging half of the victim out by his ankle . officer talbert opened fire but the fucker was too quick he took him down with the axe . ’ ‘do we have any idea of who the man is ? ’ asked the detective . ‘we don’t know yet . ’ replied sergeant webber . ‘i have officers searching the house as we speak the neighbours did mention that ms peavey was in the habit of renting rooms out to medical students . detective harrison’s eyes popped out on stalks he looked to dr fletcher who was thinking the same thing but neither of them got a chance to verbalise what they were thinking . ‘what do you mean you won’t let me through ! ’ bellowed the voice of captain talbert . ‘i am ranking officer get the hell out of my way ! ’",0,65d3efbf-1a3d-4034-9e01-079bd3bd152b,0,0.9999904632568359,0.9968176,1,0.9968176,hatespeech,1,0.99982965,0.99982965,0
